  "context": "MHR combines ATLAS's skeleton/shape paradigm with a modern rig to provide expressive, anatomically plausible human animation for AR/VR and graphics. We present MHR, aparametric human body modelthat combines thedecoupled skeleton/shapeparadigm ofATLASwith a flexible, modern rig andpose corrective systeminspired by theMomentum library. Our model enables expressive, anatomically plausible human animation, supportingnon-linear pose correctives, and is designed for robust integration inAR/VRandgraphics pipelines.
