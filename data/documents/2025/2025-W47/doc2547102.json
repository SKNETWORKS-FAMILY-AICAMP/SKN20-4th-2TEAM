  "context": "A decentralized retrieval-augmented generation system uses blockchain-based reliability scoring to manage data sources, enhancing performance and cost-efficiency compared to centralized systems. Existingretrieval-augmented generation(RAG) systems typically use a centralized architecture, causing a high cost of data collection, integration, and management, as well as privacy concerns. There is a great need for a decentralized RAG system that enables foundation models to utilize information directly from data owners who maintain full control over their sources. However, decentralization brings a challenge: the numerous independent data sources vary significantly in reliability, which can diminish retrieval accuracy and response quality. To address this, our decentralized RAG system has a novelreliability scoring mechanismthat dynamically evaluates each source based on the quality of responses it contributes to generate and prioritizes high-quality sources during retrieval. To ensure transparency and trust, the scoring process is securely managed throughblockchain-based smart contracts, creating verifiable and tamper-proof reliability records without relying on a central authority. We evaluate our decentralized system with twoLlama models(3B and 8B) in two simulated environments where six data sources have different levels of reliability. Our system achieves a +10.7\\% performance improvement over its centralized counterpart in the real world-like unreliable data environments. Notably, it approaches the upper-bound performance of centralized systems under ideally reliable data environments. The decentralized infrastructure enables secure and trustworthy scoring management, achieving approximately 56\\% marginal cost savings throughbatched update operations. Our code and system are open-sourced at github.com/yining610/Reliable-dRAG. 💻 WHAT WE BUILT: a decentralized RAG (dRAG) system that solves data reliability challenges in real-world settings. The sources provided by each data owner will be securely managed and scored on blockchain. 🚀 HOW TO DEPLOY: we provide a one-line command for easy deployment of our dRAG system athttps://github.com/yining610/Reliable-dRAG This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
