  "context": "NORA-1.5, an enhanced vision-language-action model with a flow-matching-based action expert and reward-driven post-training, improves performance and reliability in both simulated and real-world settings. Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety ofembodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it aflow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set ofreward modelsfor post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) anaction-conditioned world model(WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we constructpreference datasetsand adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments throughdirect preference optimization(DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effectivereward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.
