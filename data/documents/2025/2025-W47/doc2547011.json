Video Modelshave achieved remarkable success in high-fidelityvideo generationwithcoherent motion dynamics. Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development ofvideo modelsmotivates us to ask: Canvideo modelsreason viavideo generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts andtemporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate forspatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduceVR-Bench-- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluatevideo models' reasoning capabilities.

Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10–20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks. We have constructed a comprehensive evaluation system that facilitates objective and quantifiable assessment by tracking target trajectories in generated videos and comparing them against the ground truth. A distinctive feature of our benchmark is its ability to provide explicit reward signals for future paradigms, such as Video RL. As posited by Jason's 'Verifier Rule,' the feasibility of training AI for a task is directly proportional to the task's verifiability. Characterized by its objectivity, rapid and scalable verification, and low noise, VR-Bench serves as a highly effective benchmark within this framework.
