  "context": "VANS, a model combining reinforcement learning, a Vision-Language Model, and a Video Diffusion Model, achieves state-of-the-art performance in Video-Next-Event Prediction by generating visually consistent and semantically accurate videos. While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized asVideo-Next-Event Prediction(VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers forprocedural learningandcreative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding ofmultimodal input,instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align aVision-Language Model(VLM) with aVideo Diffusion Model(VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposedJoint-GRPOthat orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS. We pioneer Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP), extending text-based next-event prediction to dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing enables more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. To tackle VNEP, we propose VANS, a model that aligns a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) through our Joint-GRPO post-training approach. Our method bridges the semantic-to-visual gap of VLM and VDM, enabling high-quality video event prediction and generation. Cool! This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
