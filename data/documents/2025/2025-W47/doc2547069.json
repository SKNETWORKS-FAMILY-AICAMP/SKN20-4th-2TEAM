  "context": "In-context learning (ICL) -- the capacity of a model to infer and apply abstract patterns from examples provided within its input -- has been extensively studied in large language models trained for next-token prediction on human text. In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?\n  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning. For years since the GPT-2 paper, emergent in-context learning (ICL) has been treated as something deeply tied to human language. But … what if ICL isn’t uniquely tied human lang? Here is our finding: 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰🧬 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝙤𝙣𝙡𝙮 𝗼𝗻 '𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁-𝗻𝘂𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻' 𝗲𝘅𝗵𝗶𝗯𝗶𝘁 𝗜𝗖𝗟! What's remarkable is that their overall pattern closely mirrors LLMs:→ similar few-shot pattern induction→ similar log-linear gains with more shots→ similar improvement with model scale... all learned purely from DNA (nucleotide) sequences. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝘄𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝘃𝘀 𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀? We built a suite of symbolic bitstring-reasoning tasks and encoded them two ways: (1) genomic alphabet (A/T/C/G) and (2) linguistic alphabet (digits). This lets us compare Evo2 (genomic) vs Qwen3 (language) under matched few-shot prompts. 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of emergent ICL in non-[human]language symbolic sequences. It suggests that ICL is modality-agnostic, and a general consequence of large-scale autoregressive training on rich data distributions. 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗜𝗖𝗟 𝗶𝗻 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝘃𝘀 𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆? No! They share macro-level ICL trends, but each shows domain-specific inductive biases traceable to properties of DNA vs human language. 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁? No! But it suggests there may be universal distributional properties across different languages (human, DNA, etc.) that yield ICL. It remains an open question what these properties are.
