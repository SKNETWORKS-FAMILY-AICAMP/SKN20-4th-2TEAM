  "context": "ATLAS, a large-scale, cross-disciplinary evaluation suite, addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks by providing high-difficulty, original, and high-fidelity scientific problems to assess the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. The rapid advancement ofLarge Language Models(LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-worldscientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduceATLAS(AGI-Oriented TestbedforLogical Applicationin Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed bydomain experts(PhD-level and above),ATLASspans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involvingmulti-step reasoningandLaTeX-formatted expressionsover simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process ofexpert peer reviewandadversarial testingto ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel ofLLM judgesfor automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrateATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to developATLASinto a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable \"ruler\" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.
