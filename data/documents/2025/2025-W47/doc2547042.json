  "context": "Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO) uses latent world representations to assign progress-wise rewards to failed trajectories, improving efficiency and effectiveness in vision-language-action robotic manipulation tasks without external demonstrations. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting performance.Reinforcement learning(RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we proposeSelf-Referential Policy Optimization(SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework.SRPOeliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use oflatent world representationsto measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on theLIBERO benchmarkdemonstrateSRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success,SRPOachieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore,SRPOshows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on theLIBERO-Plus benchmark.
