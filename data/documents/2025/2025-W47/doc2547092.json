  "context": "Preference alignment techniques, such as those in MusicRL and DiffRhythm+, are proposed to enhance music generation by addressing human preferences and unique challenges like temporal coherence and harmonic consistency. Recent advances in generative AI for music have achieved remarkable fidelity and stylistic diversity, yet these systems often fail to align with nuanced human preferences due to the specific loss functions they use. This paper advocates for the systematic application of preference alignment techniques to music generation, addressing the fundamental gap between computational optimization and human musical appreciation. Drawing on recent breakthroughs includingMusicRL's large-scalepreference learning, multi-preference alignment frameworks likediffusion-based preference optimizationinDiffRhythm+, and inference-time optimization techniques likeText2midi-InferAlign, we discuss how these techniques can address music's unique challenges:temporal coherence,harmonic consistency, and subjective quality assessment. We identify key research challenges including scalability to long-form compositions, reliability amongst others in preference modelling. Looking forward, we envisionpreference-aligned music generationenabling transformative applications ininteractive composition toolsandpersonalized music services. This work calls for sustained interdisciplinary research combining advances in machine learning, music-theory to create music AI systems that truly serve human creative and experiential needs. Preference alignment has been notoriously difficulty with generative music. In the recent year, the space has seen some important progress.
