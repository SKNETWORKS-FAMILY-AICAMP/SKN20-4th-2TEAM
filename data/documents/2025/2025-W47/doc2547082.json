  "context": "FinTRec, a transformer-based framework, addresses challenges in financial services recommendation systems by handling long-range interactions and multiple products, outperforming traditional tree-based models. Transformer-based architecturesare widely adopted insequential recommendation systems, yet their application in Financial Services (FS) presents distinct practical and modeling challenges for real-time recommendation. These include:a)long-range user interactions(implicit and explicit) spanning both digital and physical channels generatingtemporally heterogeneous context, b) the presence of multipleinterrelated productsrequirecoordinated modelsto support varied ad placements and personalized feeds, while balancing competing business goals. We proposeFinTRec, a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and its operational objectives in FS. Whiletree-based modelshave traditionally been preferred in FS due to theirexplainabilityand alignment withregulatory requirements, our study demonstrate thatFinTRecoffers a viable and effective shift towardtransformer-based architectures. Through historic simulation and live A/B test correlations, we showFinTRecconsistently outperforms the production-grade tree-based baseline. The unified architecture, when fine-tuned forproduct adaptation, enablescross-product signal sharing, reducestraining costandtechnical debt, while improvingoffline performanceacross all products. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of unified sequential recommendation modeling in FS that addresses both technical and business considerations. This paper discusses practical challenges faced while building SOTA sequential recsys in Financial Applications. Hence, we introduce FinTrec, a framework designed to handle these challenges specifically tailored to Financial Applications. This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
