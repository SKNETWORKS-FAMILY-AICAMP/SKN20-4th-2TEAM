  "context": "Virtual Width Networks (VWN) enhance model efficiency by expanding representational width without increasing computational cost, accelerating optimization and improving loss reduction. We introduceVirtual Width Networks(VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size.VWNdecouplesrepresentational widthfrombackbone width, expanding theembedding spacewhile keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times fornext-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing thatVWNis not onlytoken-efficientbut also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width andloss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width to expand embedding space with near-constant backbone compute, achieving faster convergence and a log-linear relation between virtual width and loss reduction.
