  "context": "UI2Code$^\\text{N}$, a visual language model enhanced through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, achieves superior performance in UI-to-code generation, editing, and polishing with iterative feedback. User interface (UI) programming is a core yet highly complex part of modern software development. Recent advances invisual language models(VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactiveUI-to-codeparadigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code^N, a visual language model trained throughstaged pretraining,fine-tuning, andreinforcement learningto achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding. The model unifies three key capabilities:UI-to-code generation,UI editing, andUI polishing. We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use ofmulti-turn feedback. Experiments onUI-to-codeandUI polishing benchmarksshow that UI2Code^N establishes a new state of the art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/zai-org/UI2Code_N. UI2Code^N is a visual language foundation modeltrained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements inmultimodal coding, which unifies three key capabilities:UI-to-code generation,UI editing, andUI polishing.
