  "context": "UniVA is an open-source multi-agent framework that integrates video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows using a Plan-and-Act architecture and hierarchical memory. While specialized AI models excel at isolated video tasks like generation or understanding, real-world applications demand complex, iterative workflows that combine these capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduceUniVA, an open-source, omni-capablemulti-agent frameworkfor next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows.UniVAemploys aPlan-and-Actdual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: aplanner agentinterprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, whileexecutor agentsexecute these through modular,MCP-based tool servers(for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through ahierarchical multi-level memory(global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences),UniVAsustainslong-horizon reasoning,contextual continuity, andinter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation rightarrow multi-round editing rightarrow object segmentation rightarrow compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduceUniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite ofmulti-step video tasksspanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. BothUniVAandUniVA-Benchare fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.
