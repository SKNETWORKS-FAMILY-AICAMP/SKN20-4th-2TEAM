  "context": "Ariadne, a framework using synthetic mazes and RLVR, expands VLMs' capability in visual-centric spatial reasoning and improves zero-shot generalization on real-world benchmarks. WhileVision-Language Models(VLMs) post-trained withReinforcement Learning(RL) show impressive general reasoning, their evaluation is often confined to\nlanguage-dominant tasks (e.g., math). This raises a critical question: can RL\npost-training truly extend the inherent capability boundary of a base VLM,\nparticularly for visual-centric spatial tasks where it initially fails? To\ninvestigate this, we introduce Ariadne, a framework utilizingsynthetic mazesformulti-step spatial reasoningwhere task difficulty (e.g., path length,\nturns) is precisely controlled. We leverage this controllable environment to\ntrain VLMs usingReinforcement Learningwith Verified Rewards (RLVR) in adifficulty-aware curriculum. Surprisingly, post-RLVRtraining, the VLM achieves\nover 50% accuracy on a problem set where the base model scored 0%,\ndemonstrating that our approach expands the model's initial capability\nboundary. To assess real-world viability, we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization on practical benchmarks. Despite training only on synthetic maze\nsamples, Ariadne achieves significant zero-shot improvements, averaging 16% onMapBench(e.g., museum navigation) and 24% onReasonMap(subway transfer\ntasks). These results confirm that our method not only broadens the model's\nfundamental limits but also enhances its generalization to real-world spatial\nreasoning.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) post-trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) show impressive general reasoning, their evaluation is often confined to language-dominant tasks (e.g., math). This raises a critical question: can RL post-training truly extend the inherent capability boundary of a base VLM, particularly for visual-centric spatial tasks where it initially fails? To investigate this, we introduce Ariadne, a framework utilizing synthetic mazes for multi-step spatial reasoning where task difficulty (e.g., path length, turns) is precisely controlled. We leverage this controllable environment to train VLMs using Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards (RLVR) in a difficulty-aware curriculum. Surprisingly, post-RLVR training, the VLM achieves over 50% accuracy on a problem set where the base model scored 0%, demonstrating that our approach expands the model's initial capability boundary. To assess real-world viability, we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on practical benchmarks. Despite training only on synthetic maze samples, Ariadne achieves significant zero-shot improvements, averaging 16% on MapBench (e.g., museum navigation) and 24% on ReasonMap (subway transfer tasks). These results confirm that our method not only broadens the model's fundamental limits but also enhances its generalization to real-world spatial reasoning. We acknowledge our study is limited to the post-training phase, given the opaqueness of pre-training data, and hope our research motivates further work on specialized, capability-extending alignment.
