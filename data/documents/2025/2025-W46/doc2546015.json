  "context": "Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD) enhances black-box distillation by framing the student model as a generator and using a discriminator to provide adaptive feedback, surpassing traditional sequence-level knowledge distillation. Black-box distillationcreates studentlarge language models (LLMs)by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduceGenerative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy andblack-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as ageneratorand trains adiscriminatorto distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating aminimax game. Thediscriminatoracts as anon-policy reward modelthat co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly usedsequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on theLMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.
