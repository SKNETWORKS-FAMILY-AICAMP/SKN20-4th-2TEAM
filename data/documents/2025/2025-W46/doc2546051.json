  "context": "A new task, Dense Motion Captioning, is introduced with a large-scale dataset, CompMo, and a model, DEMO, that integrates a language model with a motion adapter to generate detailed, temporally grounded captions for 3D human motion sequences. Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily\nfocused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding\nrelatively unexplored. We introduceDense Motion Captioning, a novel task that\naims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion\nsequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal\nannotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.\nTo overcome these limitations, we present theComplex Motion Dataset(CompMo),\nthe first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion\nsequences with precisetemporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed\ndata generation pipeline,CompMoincludes 60,000motion sequences, each\ncomposed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately\nannotated with their temporal extents. We further presentDEMO, a model that\nintegrates alarge language modelwith a simplemotion adapter, trained to\ngenerate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show thatDEMOsubstantially outperforms existing methods onCompMoas well as on adapted\nbenchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion\nunderstanding and captioning.
