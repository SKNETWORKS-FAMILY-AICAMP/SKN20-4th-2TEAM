  "context": "AdvancedIF benchmark and RIFL pipeline improve instruction-following capabilities in large language models by using expert-curated rubrics and reinforcement learning techniques. Recent progress inlarge language models (LLMs)has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advancedinstruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, andsystem-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality,human-annotated benchmarksand reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curatedrubricsthat assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leveragesrubric generation, a finetunedrubric verifier, andreward shapingto enable effectivereinforcement learningfor instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishesrubricsas a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems. Introduces AdvancedIF benchmark and RIFL, a rubric-driven post-training RL pipeline to improve instruction-following in LLMs. This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
