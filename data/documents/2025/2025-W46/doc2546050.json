  "context": "The Generative Semantic Workspace (GSW) enhances LLMs' long-context reasoning by creating structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, outperforming existing methods on the Episodic Memory Benchmark and reducing inference time. Large Language Models(LLMs) face fundamental challenges inlong-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finitecontext windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation withexternal memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval usingsemantic embeddingsto more sophisticated structuredknowledge graphsrepresentations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose theGenerative Semantic Workspace(GSW), aneuro-inspired generative memoryframework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises anOperator, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and aReconciler, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On theEpisodic Memory Benchmark(EpBench) huet_episodic_2025 comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to 20\\%. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by 51\\% compared to the next mosttoken-efficientbaseline, reducinginference timecosts considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs withhuman-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.
