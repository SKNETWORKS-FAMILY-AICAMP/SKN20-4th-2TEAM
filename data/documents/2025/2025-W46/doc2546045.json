  "context": "Real-Time Reasoning Gym demonstrates the challenges of deploying language models in dynamic environments, introducing AgileThinker to balance reasoning depth and response latency. Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely\njudgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:\nhazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's\nreasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,\nexisting approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introducereal-time reasoningas a new problem formulation for agents in evolving\nenvironments and buildReal-Time ReasoningGym to demonstrate it. We study two\nparadigms for deploying language models in agents: (1)reactive agents, which\nemploy language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,\nand (2)planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex\nproblems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with\nmaking logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this\nlimitation, we proposeAgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both\nreasoning paradigms.AgileThinkerconsistently outperforms agents engaging only\none reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,\neffectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work\nestablishesreal-time reasoningas a critical testbed for developing practical\nagents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI\nsystems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents. Current AI agent loop is not enough for real-world applications. Reasoning models take too much time to plan, while non-reasoning models cannot see far enough. In the real world, we want the agent to be both smart and reactive enough to deal with emergent hazards, opportunities, or coordinate with partners. 🎯 3 Dynamic Games – Freeway, Snake, and Overcooked⚡ Time Pressure – More reaction is needed for higher time pressure🧠 Cognitive Load – More planning is needed for heavier cognitive load Traditional AI agents think step-by-step.
