  "context": "VLA models, combining vision, language, and action, are advancing through milestones like multimodality, reasoning, and safety, with trends focusing on spatial understanding and human coordination. Due to their ability of follow natural language instructions,vision-language-action (VLA) modelsare increasingly prevalent in the embodied\nAI arena, following the widespread success of their precursors -- LLMs and\nVLMs. In this paper, we discuss 10 principal milestones in the ongoing\ndevelopment of VLA models --multimodality,reasoning,data,evaluation,cross-robot action generalization,efficiency,whole-body coordination,safety,agents, andcoordination with humans. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging\ntrends of usingspatial understanding,modeling world dynamics,post training,\nanddata synthesis-- all aiming to reach these milestones. Through these\ndiscussions, we hope to bring attention to the research avenues that may\naccelerate the development of VLA models into wider acceptability. 10 Open Challenges Steering the Future of Vision-Language-Action Models This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
