In this\nwork, we study how to convert existing pretrained non-recurrent language models\ninto depth-recurrent models. We find that using acurriculum of recurrencesto\nincrease theeffective depthof the model over the course of training preserves\nperformance while reducing totalcomputational cost. In our experiments, onmathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones\nresults in better performance at a given compute budget than simplypost-trainingthe original non-recurrent language model.
