  "context": "A fully automated data evolution framework, LoopTool, enhances tool-use capabilities of Large Language Models by iteratively refining data and model through a closed-loop process. AugmentingLarge Language Models(LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduceLoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training.LoopTooliteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1)Greedy Capability Probing(GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2)Judgement-Guided Label Verification(JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3)Error-Driven Data Expansion(EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained withLoopToolsignificantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on theBFCL-v3andACEBenchbenchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs. Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks.
