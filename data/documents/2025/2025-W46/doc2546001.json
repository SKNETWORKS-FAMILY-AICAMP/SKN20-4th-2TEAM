  "context": "Lumine, a vision-language model-based agent, completes complex missions in real-time across different 3D open-world environments with human-like efficiency and zero-shot cross-game generalization. We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts ahuman-like interactionparadigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in anend-to-endmanner, powered by avision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strongzero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments. Proposes Lumine, an open, end-to-end vision-language agent for generalist, long-horizon tasks in 3D open worlds, achieving human-level efficiency and zero-shot cross-game generalization without fine-tuning. This work is so amazing!!!
