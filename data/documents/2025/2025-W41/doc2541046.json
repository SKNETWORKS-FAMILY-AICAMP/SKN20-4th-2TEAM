  "context": "A language-mixed chain-of-thought reasoning approach improves performance in Korean-specific tasks by switching between English and Korean, achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks. Recent frontier models employ longchain-of-thought reasoningto explore\nsolution spaces in context and achieve stonger performance. While many works\nstudy distillation to build smaller yet capable models, most focus on English\nand little is known about language-specific reasoning. To bridge this gap, we\nfirst introduct **Language-Mixed CoT**, a reasoning schema that switches\nbetween English and a target language, using English as an anchor to excel in\nreasoning while minimizing translation artificats. As a Korean case study, we\ncurate **Yi-Sang**: 5.79M native-Korean prompts from web Q&A, exams, STEM, and\ncode; 3.7M long reasoning traces generated fromQwen3-32B; and a targeted 260k\nhigh-yield subset. We train ninve models (4B-35B) across six families (Qwen2.5,\nLlama-3.1, Gemma-3, etc). Our best model, **KO-REAson-35B**, achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the highest overall average score (64.0 \\pm\n25), ranking first on 5/9 benchmarks and second on the remainder. Samller and\nmid-sized models also benefit substantially, with an average improvement of\n+18.6 points across teh evaluated nine benchmarks. Ablations show\n**Language-Mixed CoT** is more effective thanmonolingual CoT, also resulting\nincross-lingualandmult-modalperformance gains. We release our data-curation\npipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and models to advance research on\nlanguage-specific reasoning. Data and model collection:\nhttps://huggingface.co/KOREAson.
