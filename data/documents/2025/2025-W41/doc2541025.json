Diffusion language modelspromisebidirectional contextand infilling\ncapabilities thatautoregressive coderslack, yet practical systems remain\nheavyweight. We introduce CoDA, a 1.7B-parameterdiffusion codertrained on TPU\nwith a fully open-source training pipeline. CoDA pairs large-scale diffusion\npre-training withcode-centric mid-trainingandinstruction tuning, enablingconfidence-guided samplingthat keepsinference latencycompetitive. OnHumaneval,MBPP, andEvalPlus, CoDA-1.7B-Instruct matches or surpasses\ndiffusion models up to 7B parameters. Our release includes model checkpoints,\nevaluation harnesses, and TPU training pipelines to accelerate research on\nlightweightdiffusion-based coding assistants. CoDA-1.7B  is born for code editing ✍️tasks while overall coding performances on par with 7B models. The cool part is it does parallel decoding so it’s blazingly fast ⚡️during inference! The models, pre/mid/post-training code and frameworks have all been open-sourced: → 🤗 𝗛𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗙𝗮𝗰𝗲:https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/CoDA-v0-Instruct→ 🤖 𝗚𝗶𝘁𝗛𝘂𝗯:https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/CoDA/→ 📑 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁:https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.03270 This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
