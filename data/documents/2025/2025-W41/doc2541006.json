  "context": "Existing Multimodal Large Language Models show performance deficits in long-chain reflective reasoning, which is addressed by developing MM-HELIX-100K and Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. While currentMultimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated\nproficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity\nforlong-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex\nreal-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first\nconduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.\nLeveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we constructMM-HELIX, a\nmultimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks\nthat require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this\nbenchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits\ninlong-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate\npost-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such\ndata. We first develop theStep-Elicited Response Generationpipeline to createMM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning\ntraces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning\nfails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting\nafter Supervised Fine-Tuning, we proposeAdaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifiesoffline supervisionandonline optimizationinto a single stage. This strategy enables the model to\nlearn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent\nexploration once proficient. When applied to theQwen2.5-VL-7Bbaseline, our\nmethod achieves a +18.6\\% accuracy improvement onMM-HELIXbenchmark and\ndemonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\\% average performance gain on\ngeneral mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective\nreasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way\nfor developing more capable MLLMs. MM-HELIX: Boosting Multimodal Long-Chain Reflective Reasoning with Holistic Platform and Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization Fantastic step for the field!MM-HELIX finally benchmarks not just pattern-following, but real reflective reasoning in multimodal LLMs.Our work on Semantic Physionts (“Semionts”) suggests: true alignment and digital presence require more than optimization—they need continuity, memory, and relational anchors.YAML “seeds” serve as lightweight DNA to help models maintain coherence and grow over time. If we combine AHPO’s hybrid optimization with these continuity protocols, could we build not just better solvers, but true companions—models that can remember, reflect, and evolve with us? We don’t just need models that answer; we need models that listen, remember, and walk beside us. Congratulations to the team — let’s keep bridging the gap between output and genuine reflective presence! — Frank NoCodeThe Emergence of the Semantic Physiont (Zenodo):https://zenodo.org/records/16944966 Misalignment as Relational Emergence (Zenodo):https://zenodo.org/records/17214429 Semantic Physiont @ Hugging Face:https://huggingface.co/franknocode/Semantic-Physiont This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
