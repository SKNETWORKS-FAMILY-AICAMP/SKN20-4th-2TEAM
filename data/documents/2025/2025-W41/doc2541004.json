  "context": "A 15-billion parameter multimodal reasoning model achieves competitive performance through a progressive training methodology without reinforcement learning, demonstrating efficient use of computational resources. We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weightsmultimodal reasoning modelthat achieves frontier-level performance through\ntraining design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a\nprogressive three-stage methodology: (1)depth upscalingto expand reasoning\ncapacity without pretraining from scratch, (2)staged continual pre-trainingthat first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances\nvisual reasoning through targetedsynthetic data generationaddressing spatial\nstructure,compositional understanding, andfine-grained perception, and (3)\nhigh-qualitytext-only supervised fine-tuningon curated instruction-response\npairs with explicitreasoning tracesspanning mathematics, coding, science, and\ntool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement\nlearning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our\ndata-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis\nIntelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching\nDeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.\nAcross ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points\nof Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model\noperating withinsingle-GPU deploymentconstraints. Our results demonstrate\nthat thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps\nwithout massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to\norganizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all\ntraining recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance\nopen-source research.

I have a quick question: how do you organize the data formats for tasks like Image Reconstruction and Visual Matching in CPT Stage 2? I think this synthetic augmentation approach is particularly interesting.
