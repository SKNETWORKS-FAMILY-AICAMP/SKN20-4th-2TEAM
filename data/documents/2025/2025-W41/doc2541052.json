  "context": "The African Languages Lab addresses the underserved status of African languages in NLP by creating a large dataset and demonstrating improved model performance through fine-tuning. Despite representing nearly one-third of the world's languages, African\nlanguages remain critically underserved by modern NLP technologies, with 88\\%\nclassified as severely underrepresented or completely ignored in computational\nlinguistics. We present the African Languages Lab (All Lab), a comprehensive\nresearch initiative that addresses this technological gap through systematic\ndata collection, model development, and capacity building. Our contributions\ninclude: (1) a quality-controlled data collection pipeline, yielding the\nlargest validated Africanmulti-modal speech and text datasetspanning 40\nlanguages with 19 billion tokens of monolingual text and 12,628 hours of\naligned speech data; (2) extensive experimental validation demonstrating that\nour dataset, combined withfine-tuning, achieves substantial improvements over\nbaseline models, averaging +23.69ChrF++, +0.33COMET, and +15.34BLEUpoints\nacross 31 evaluated languages; and (3) a structured research program that has\nsuccessfully mentored fifteen early-career researchers, establishing\nsustainable local capacity. Our comparative evaluation againstGoogle Translatereveals competitive performance in several languages while identifying areas\nthat require continued development. This paper introduces the African Languages Lab (ALL Lab), a collaborative research initiative aimed at closing the significant gap in NLP support for African languages, 88% of which are currently underrepresented or ignored in computational linguistics. In short, the All Lab demonstrates that systematic data collection, open collaboration, and local capacity building can improve NLP performance for low-resourced languages, bridging one of AI’s most urgent linguistic gaps. quick, bullet-point summary of the key findingsfrom the paper: 🗂️Introduces a Large African NLP dataset 📈Major performance gains after fine-tuning 🌍Severe underrepresentation revealed ⚖️Two digital divides identified 💡Low-resource languages benefit most 🔬Different improvement patterns observed 🧪Metrics show nuanced progress 🧭Core takeaway: This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
