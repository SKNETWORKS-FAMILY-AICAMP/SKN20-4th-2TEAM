  "context": "WaltzRL, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, improves LLM safety and helpfulness by collaboratively training a conversation agent and a feedback agent, reducing unsafe responses and overrefusals. Harnessing the power ofLLMsrequires a delicate dance between being helpful\nand harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing\nchallenges: vulnerability toadversarial attacksthat elicit unsafe content,\nand a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current\napproaches often navigate this dance withsafeguard modelsthat completely\nreject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music\nentirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance\nfor queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we\npropose WaltzRL, a novelmulti-agent reinforcement learningframework that\nformulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL\njointly trains aconversation agentand afeedback agent, where the latter is\nincentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and\nhelpfulness of theconversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is aDynamic Improvement Reward(DIR) that evolves over time based on how well theconversation agentincorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or\noverrefusing responses from theconversation agentare improved rather than\ndiscarded. Thefeedback agentis deployed together with theconversation agentand only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency\non safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,\ndemonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,\nfrom 39.0% to 4.6% onWildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% onOR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation andfeedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances\nLLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto\nfront between helpfulness and harmlessness.
