  "context": "EgoX framework generates egocentric videos from exocentric inputs using video diffusion models with LoRA adaptation, unified conditioning, and geometry-guided self-attention for coherence and visual fidelity. Egocentric perception enables humans to experience and understand the world directly from their own point of view. Translating exocentric (third-person) videos into egocentric (first-person) videos opens up new possibilities for immersive understanding but remains highly challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap. This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generatingegocentric videosfrom a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scalevideo diffusion modelsthrough lightweightLoRA adaptationand introduces aunified conditioningstrategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors viawidth and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, ageometry-guided self-attentionmechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos.
