  "context": "Multimodal large language models can be enhanced for visual generation by enabling direct reasoning and planning in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces rather than just serving as text encoders for diffusion models. Multimodal learning has rapidly advanced visual understanding, largely viamultimodal large language models(MLLMs) that use powerful LLMs as cognitive cores. In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders fordiffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial andspatiotemporal latent spacesand interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, includingtext-to-image generation,text/image-to-video generation,image/video editing, andin-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs aslatent-space plannersis a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.
