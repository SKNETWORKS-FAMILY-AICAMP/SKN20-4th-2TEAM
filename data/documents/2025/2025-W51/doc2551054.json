  "context": "EasyV2V framework enhances video editing by combining diverse data sources, leveraging pretrained text-to-video models with LoRA fine-tuning, and implementing unified spatiotemporal control, achieving top results. While image editing has advanced rapidly, video editing remains less explored, facing challenges in consistency, control, and generalization. We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduceEasyV2V, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing.
