  "context": "Scone is a unified method for subject distinction in multi-subject image generation that uses semantic bridging and two-stage training to improve both composition and subject identification. Subject-driven image generation has advanced from single- to multi-subjectcomposition, while neglecting distinction, the ability to identify and generate the correct subject when inputs contain multiple candidates. This limitation restricts effectiveness in complex, realistic visual settings. We propose Scone, a unified understanding-generation method that integratescompositionand distinction. Scone enables the understanding expert to act as a semantic bridge, conveying semantic information and guiding the generation expert to preserve subject identity while minimizing interference. Atwo-stage trainingscheme first learnscomposition, then enhances distinction throughsemantic alignmentandattention-based masking. We also introduce SconeEval, a benchmark for evaluating bothcompositionand distinction across diverse scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that Scone outperforms existing open-source models incompositionand distinction tasks on two benchmarks.
