Conventional evaluation methods formultimodal LLMs(MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduceAuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence.AuditDMfine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor viareinforcement learningto generatechallenging questionsandcounterfactual imagesthat maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that revealmodel weaknessesand serve asannotation-free dataforrectification. When applied to SoTA models likeGemma-3andPaliGemma-2,AuditDMdiscovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart.
