  "context": "A systematic study adapts diffusion distillation techniques to text-to-image generation, providing guidelines for successful implementation and deployment. Diffusion distillationhas dramatically acceleratedclass-conditional image synthesis, but its applicability to open-ended text-to-image (T2I) generation is still unclear. We present the first systematic study that adapts and compares state-of-the-art distillation techniques on a strong T2I teacher model,FLUX.1-lite. By casting existing methods into aunified framework, we identify the key obstacles that arise when moving fromdiscrete class labelstofree-form language prompts. Beyond a thorough methodological analysis, we offer practical guidelines oninput scaling,network architecture, andhyperparameters, accompanied by an open-source implementation and pretrained student models. Our findings establish a solid foundation for deploying fast, high-fidelity, and resource-efficientdiffusion generatorsin real-world T2I applications.

A Systematic Study of Diffusion Distillation for Text-to-Image Synthesis towards truly applicable few steps distillation, casting existing distillation methods (sCM, MeanFlow and IMM) into a unified framework for fair comparison.
