  "context": "A diffusion model for decomposing RGB images into semantically disentangled RGBA layers enables consistent image editing through independent manipulation of individual layers. Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose Qwen-Image-Layered, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling inherent editability, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) anRGBA-VAEto unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) aVLD-MMDiT(Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) aMulti-stage Trainingstrategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.
