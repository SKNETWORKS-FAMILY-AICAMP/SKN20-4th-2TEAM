We introduce Olmo 3, a family of state-of-the-art,fully-open language modelsat the 7B and 32B parameter scales. Olmo 3 model construction targetslong-context reasoning,function calling, coding,instruction following,general chat, andknowledge recall. This release includes the entiremodel flow, i.e., the fulllifecycleof the family of models, including every stage, checkpoint, data point, and dependency used to build it. Our flagship model, Olmo 3 Think 32B, is the strongest fully-open thinking model released to-date.
