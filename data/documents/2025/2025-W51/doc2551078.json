  "context": "FlashPortrait is a diffusion-based video transformer for long-portrait animation that ensures ID consistency and achieves 6x acceleration through a dynamic sliding-window scheme and higher-order latent derivatives. Current diffusion-based acceleration methods for long-portrait animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-endvideo diffusion transformercapable of synthesizingID-preserving,infinite-length videoswhile achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing theidentity-agnostic facial expression featureswith an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces aNormalized Facial Expression Blockto align facial features withdiffusion latentsby normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts adynamic sliding-window schemewithweighted blendingin overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on thelatent variation rateat particular timesteps and thederivative magnitude ratioamong diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizeshigher-order latent derivativesat the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.
