  "context": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks integrate visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs to enhance autonomous driving, offering more interpretable and human-aligned driving policies. Autonomous driving has long relied on modular \"Perception-Decision-Action\" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control.Vision-Action (VA) modelsaddress some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress inLarge Language Models (LLMs)andmultimodal learninghas motivated the emergence ofVision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms:End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, andDual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such astextual vs. numerical action generatorsandexplicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.
