  "context": "Nano Banana Pro shows promise as a zero-shot generalist for low-level vision tasks but struggles to match specialist models in quantitative metrics due to inherent stochasticity in generative processes. The rapid evolution oftext-to-image generation modelshas revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditionallow-level visionchallenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro aLow-Level VisionAll-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensivezero-shot evaluationacross 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherentstochasticityofgenerative models, which struggle to maintain the strictpixel-level consistencyrequired by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender forlow-level visiontasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.
