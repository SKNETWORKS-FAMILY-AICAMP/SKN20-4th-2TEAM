  "context": "Iceberg is a benchmark suite that evaluates vector similarity search methods in real-world contexts, identifying key sources of performance degradation and providing guidance for selecting and tuning these methods. Vector Similarity Search(VSS) in high-dimensional spaces is rapidly emerging as core functionality in next-generation database systems for numerous data-intensive services -- fromembedding lookupsinlarge language models(LLMs), tosemantic information retrievalandrecommendation engines. Current benchmarks, however, evaluateVSSprimarily on therecall-latency trade-offagainst a ground truth defined solely by distance metrics, neglecting how retrieval quality ultimately impacts downstream tasks. This disconnect can mislead both academic research and industrial practice.\n  We present Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation ofVSSmethods in realistic application contexts. From a task-centric view, Iceberg uncovers theInformation Loss Funnel, which identifies three principal sources of end-to-end performance degradation: (1)Embedding Lossduring feature extraction; (2)Metric Misuse, where distances poorly reflect task relevance; (3)Data Distribution Sensitivity, highlighting index robustness across skews and modalities. For a more comprehensive assessment, Iceberg spans eight diverse datasets across key domains such as image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems. Each dataset, ranging from 1M to 100M vectors, includes rich,task-specific labelsandevaluation metrics, enabling assessment of retrieval algorithms within the fullapplication pipelinerather than in isolation. Iceberg benchmarks 13state-of-the-art VSS methodsand re-ranks them based on application-level metrics, revealing substantial deviations from traditional rankings derived purely from recall-latency evaluations. Building on these insights, we define a set oftask-centric meta-featuresand derive an interpretabledecision treeto guide practitioners in selecting and tuningVSSmethods for their specific workloads.
