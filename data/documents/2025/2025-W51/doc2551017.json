  "context": "NL2Repo Bench evaluates long-horizon software development capabilities of coding agents by assessing their ability to generate complete Python libraries from natural-language requirements. Recent advances incoding agentssuggest rapid progress towardautonomous software development, yet existing benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon capabilities required to build complete software systems. Most prior evaluations focus on localized code generation, scaffolded completion, or short-term repair tasks, leaving open the question of whether agents can sustain coherent reasoning, planning, and execution over the extended horizons demanded by real-world repository construction. To address this gap, we presentNL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate thelong-horizon repository generationability ofcoding agents. Given only a singlenatural-language requirementsdocument and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implementmulti-module logic, and produce a fullyinstallable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal thatlong-horizon repository generationremains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% averagetest pass ratesand rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss ofglobal coherence, fragilecross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps.NL2Repo Benchestablishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlightslong-horizon reasoningas a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomouscoding agents.
