  "context": "Kling-Omni is a versatile generative framework that synthesizes high-quality videos from multimodal inputs, integrating generation, editing, and reasoning into a unified system. We present Kling-Omni, a generalistgenerative frameworkdesigned to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly frommultimodal visual language inputs. Adopting anend-to-endperspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diversevideo generation,editing, andintelligent reasoningtasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into aunified multimodal representationto delivercinematic-qualityand highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered byefficient large-scale pre-trainingstrategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities inin-context generation,reasoning-based editing, andmultimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement towardmultimodal world simulatorscapable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

The end-to-end design + in-context reasoning is especially interesting — pipelines always felt like a bottleneck here. Feels like the line between “video model” and “interactive world model” is starting to blur. Excited to see how the community experiments with this next. 🚀🧠 ·Sign uporlog into comment",
