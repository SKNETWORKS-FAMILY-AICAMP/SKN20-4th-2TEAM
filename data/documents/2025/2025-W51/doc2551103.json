  "context": "VABench is a benchmark framework for evaluating audio-video generation models, covering text-to-audio-video, image-to-audio-video, and stereo audio-video tasks with 15 evaluation dimensions. Recent advances in video generation have been remarkable, enabling models to produce visually compelling videos with synchronized audio. While existing video generation benchmarks provide comprehensive metrics for visual quality, they lack convincing evaluations for audio-video generation, especially for models aiming to generate synchronized audio-video outputs. To address this gap, we introduce VABench, a comprehensive and multi-dimensional benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of synchronous audio-video generation. VABench encompasses three primary task types:text-to-audio-video(T2AV),image-to-audio-video(I2AV), andstereo audio-video generation. It further establishes two major evaluation modules covering 15 dimensions. These dimensions specifically assesspairwise similarities(text-video, text-audio, video-audio),audio-video synchronization,lip-speech consistency, and carefully curated audio and video question-answering (QA) pairs, among others. Furthermore, VABench covers seven major content categories:animals,human sounds,music,environmental sounds,synchronous physical sounds,complex scenes, andvirtual worlds. We provide a systematic analysis and visualization of the evaluation results, aiming to establish a new standard for assessing video generation models with synchronous audio capabilities and to promote the comprehensive advancement of the field. code link:https://github.com/tanABCC/VABench arXiv lens breakdown of this paper 👉https://arxivlens.com/PaperView/Details/vabench-a-comprehensive-benchmark-for-audio-video-generation-5469-093c5d48 ·Sign uporlog into comment",
