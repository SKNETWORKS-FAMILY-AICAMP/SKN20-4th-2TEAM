  "context": "Generative Refocusing uses semi-supervised learning with DeblurNet and BokehNet to achieve high-quality single-image refocusing with controllable bokeh and text-guided adjustments. Depth-of-field control is essential in photography, but getting the perfect focus often takes several tries or special equipment. Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that usesDeblurNetto recover all-in-focus images from various inputs andBokehNetfor creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation issemi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, usingEXIF metadatato capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance indefocus deblurring,bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allowstext-guided adjustmentsand custom aperture shapes.

Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes. arXiv lens breakdown of this paper 👉https://arxivlens.com/PaperView/Details/generative-refocusing-flexible-defocus-control-from-a-single-image-668-9cd75d7c ·Sign uporlog into comment",
