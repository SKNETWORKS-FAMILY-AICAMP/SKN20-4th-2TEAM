  "context": "A unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) for SVG understanding, editing, and generation leverages a comprehensive dataset and benchmark to achieve superior performance across various tasks. General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited\ntransferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling\nstructural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and\ngeneralization capabilities ofmultimodal large language models(MLLMs) to\nachieve unified modeling forSVG understanding, editing, and generation. We\npresent the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its\ncore isSAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG\ntasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers\nicons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic\nanimations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper\nhierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this\nresource, we introduceSArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task\ndefinitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and\ndifficulty spectrum covered bySAgoge. Building on these foundations, we\npropose InternSVG, a unified MLLM forSVG understanding, editing, and\ngeneration withSVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding\ninitialization, and atwo-stage training strategythat progresses from short\nstatic SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified\nformulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.\nExperiments onSArenaand prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves\nsubstantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary\ncounterparts.  General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.Project Page This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
