  "context": "AnyUp is a feature-agnostic upsampling method that generalizes across different vision features and resolutions without requiring re-training. We introduce AnyUp, a method forfeature upsamplingthat can be applied to\nanyvision featureat any resolution, without encoder-specific training.\nExisting learning-based upsamplers for features likeDINOorCLIPneed to be\nre-trained for everyfeature extractorand thus do not generalize to different\nfeature types at inference time. In this work, we propose aninference-timefeature-agnosticupsampling architectureto alleviate this limitation and\nimprove upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the\nart for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and\npreservesfeature semanticswhile being efficient and easy to apply to a wide\nrange ofdownstream tasks.
