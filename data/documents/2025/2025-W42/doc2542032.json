  "context": "BEAR is a comprehensive benchmark evaluating multimodal large language models' embodied capabilities, and BEAR-Agent enhances these models by integrating pretrained vision models, improving performance across various tasks. Embodied capabilitiesrefer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent\nto perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and\nsystematic evaluation of theirembodied capabilitiesremains underexplored, as\nexisting benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or\nspatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduceBEAR, a comprehensive\nand fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied\ncapabilities.BEARcomprises 4,469 interleavedimage-video-text entriesacross\n14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory\nunderstanding,spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation\nresults of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across\nall domains ofembodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we proposeBEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision\nmodels to strengthen MLLM perception,3D understanding, and planning\ncapabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverseembodied capabilitiesonBEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative\nimprovement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that\nimproving MLLMembodied capabilitiescan benefit embodied tasks in simulated\nenvironments.

We also provide detailed failure analysis in order for model improvements! 😈 To further improve the performance of language models on embodied capabilities, we propose BEAR-Agent🤖，a multimodal conversable agent 🪄✨🛸 to improve the model's zero-shot capabilities on BEAR! We will release our code on Github page ⌛️⚽️， and we will update further results on it!🙏 This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot. I found the following papers similar to this paper.
