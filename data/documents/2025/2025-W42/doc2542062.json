We introduceGenerative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin\ndesigned for next-generationmultimodal reasoninginvision-language modelsand\nunified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection\nand refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.\nThis work makes three main contributions: (1) We buildViVerBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating\nvisual outcomes inmultimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs\nconsistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap\nfrom human-level capability in reliablevisual verification.

Beyond generation, we extend universal\nverifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.\nEmpirically,OmniVerifier-TTSachieves improvements onT2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),\nandGenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,\nsuch as Best-of-N.
