  "context": "Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations\nthat empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the\nevolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language\nmodels, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world\napplications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support,\nunstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we\nintroduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that\naddresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural\ndesign. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme\nto boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning.\nSpecifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the\nmodel's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched\ncross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement\ntraining further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios\nby distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while\nmining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic\nspecialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training\nflexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding\nachieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval\ntasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated\nwith our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a\ncrucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model\ndelivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the\nDouyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features\nproduced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.
