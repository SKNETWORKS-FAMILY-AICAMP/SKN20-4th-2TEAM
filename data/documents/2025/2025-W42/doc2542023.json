  "context": "RAG-Anything is a unified framework that enhances multimodal knowledge retrieval by integrating cross-modal relationships and semantic matching, outperforming existing methods on complex benchmarks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm\nfor expandingLarge Language Modelsbeyond their static training limitations.\nHowever, a critical misalignment exists between currentRAGcapabilities and\nreal-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are\ninherentlymultimodal, containing rich combinations oftextual content, visual\nelements,structured tables, andmathematical expressions. Yet existingRAGframeworks are limited totextual content, creating fundamental gaps when\nprocessingmultimodaldocuments. We presentRAG-Anything, a unified framework\nthat enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our\napproach reconceptualizesmultimodalcontent as interconnected knowledge\nentities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph\nconstruction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics\nwithin a unified representation. We developcross-modal hybrid retrievalthat\ncombinesstructural knowledge navigationwithsemantic matching. This enables\neffective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans\nmultiple modalities.RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on\nchallengingmultimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced onlong documentswhere traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a\nnew paradigm formultimodalknowledge access, eliminating the architectural\nfragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced\nat: https://github.com/HKUDS/RAG-Anything. This paper proposes RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities.
