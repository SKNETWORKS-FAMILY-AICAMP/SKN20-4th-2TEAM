  "context": "D2E framework uses desktop interactions to pretrain embodied AI, achieving high success rates in physical manipulation and navigation tasks. Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yetembodied AIremains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.Desktop environments-- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:\nthey provide richsensorimotor interactionsat scale while maintaining the\nstructured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We\npresent D2E (Desktop toEmbodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop\ninteractions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for roboticsembodied AItasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT\nfor Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a\ncomplete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in\nembodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) theOWA Toolkitthat unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x\ncompression, (2) theGeneralist-IDMthat achieves strong zero-shot\ngeneralization across unseen games throughtimestamp-based event prediction,\nenablinginternet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3)VAPTthat transfers\ndesktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.\nUsing 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of\npseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO\nmanipulation and 83.3% onCANVAS navigationbenchmarks. This validates that\nsensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance\nto transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop\npretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work\npublic, including theOWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and\npseudo-labeled, andVAPT-trained models available at\nhttps://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/ We presentD2E 🎮→🤖, a framework that scalesVision-Action Pretrainingondesktop interaction datato accelerateEmbodied AI🚀.By turning ordinary game and desktop interactions into training fuel,D2Ebuilds richvisuomotor priorsthat transfer from screens to robots ✨OWA Toolkit 🖥️— a unified recorder + storage format formulti-modal desktop data(screen, keyboard, mouse).OWAcompresses raw gameplay into a compactOWAMcapformat — achieving152× storage efficiencywhile preservingtemporal precision⚡. 🧠Generalist-IDM— a universal inverse dynamics model predictingnext-event tokenspurely fromtimestamps⏱️.It generalizes to unseen games and enablespseudo-labeling of 1,055 h of YouTube gameplay, trained with the dataset far beyond259 h of human-recorded data across 20 games🎮📊. 🔬VAPT (Vision-Action PreTraining)— pretraining a1B-param InternVL3 backboneon our1.3K hours dataset, then transferring toreal-world robot domains🦾. 🤖 When transferred to embodied domains,D2Eachieves96.6 %🔥 success on LIBERO-manipulationand83.3 %🔥 on CANVAS-navigation, demonstratingstrong generalizationfrom desktop to real-world tasks. 🌍D2Edemonstrates thatdesktop-scale learningcan unlocklow-cost, high-transfer embodied intelligenceand enableinternet-scale embodied ai pretraining, bringing the gap between thedigital and physical worlds. 📄Paper:https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05684💻Project:https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/ This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
