  "context": "A unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control, InternVLA-M1, enhances instruction-following robots through spatially guided vision-language-action training, achieving significant improvements across various tasks and simulations. We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework forspatial groundingand\nrobot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,\ngeneral-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guidedvision-language-action training, wherespatial groundingserves as the critical\nlink between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage\npipeline: (i)spatial groundingpre-training on over 2.3Mspatial reasoningdata to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,\nembodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training\nto decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through\nplug-and-playspatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields\nconsistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance\nby +14.6% onSimplerEnvGoogle Robot, +17% onWidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO\nFranka, while demonstrating strongerspatial reasoningcapability in box,\npoint, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a\nsimulation engine to collect 244K generalizablepick-and-placeepisodes,\nenabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In\nreal-world clusteredpick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with\nsynthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel\nconfigurations.
