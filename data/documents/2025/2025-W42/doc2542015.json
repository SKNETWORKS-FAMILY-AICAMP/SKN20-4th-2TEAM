  "context": "Alpha-Service, a unified framework for proactive AI assistance, uses a multi-agent system on AI glasses to detect service opportunities and provide timely, personalized assistance. In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and\nadaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm\nthat enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI\nservices remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We\nargue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of\nanticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To\nrealize this vision, we proposeAlpha-Service, a unified framework that\naddresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting\nservice opportunities fromegocentric video streams, and Know How to provide\nboth generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann\ncomputer architecture and based onAI glasses,Alpha-Serviceconsists of five\nkey components: anInput Unitfor perception, aCentral Processing Unitfor\ntask scheduling, anArithmetic Logic Unitfor tool utilization, aMemory Unitfor long-term personalization, and anOutput Unitfor natural human\ninteraction. As an initial exploration, we implementAlpha-Servicethrough amulti-agent systemdeployed onAI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time\nBlackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,\ndemonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user\nintent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.
