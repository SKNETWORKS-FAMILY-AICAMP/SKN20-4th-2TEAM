  "context": "Nemotron Nano V2 VL, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer LLM, improves document and video understanding through enhanced architecture and token reduction techniques. We introduce Nemotron Nano V2 VL, the latest model of the Nemotron\nvision-language series designed for strong real-world document understanding,\nlong video comprehension, and reasoning tasks. Nemotron Nano V2 VL delivers\nsignificant improvements over our previous model,\nLlama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-VL-8B, across all vision and text domains through major\nenhancements in model architecture, datasets, and training recipes. Nemotron\nNano V2 VL builds on Nemotron Nano V2, a hybridMamba-TransformerLLM, and\ninnovativetoken reduction techniquesto achieve higher inference throughput in\nlong document and video scenarios. We are releasing model checkpoints inBF16,FP8, andFP4formats and sharing large parts of our datasets, recipes and\ntraining code.
