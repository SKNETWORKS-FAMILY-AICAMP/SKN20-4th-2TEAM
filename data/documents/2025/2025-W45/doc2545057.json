  "context": "Trove is an open-source retrieval toolkit that streamlines data management and experimentation with efficient on-the-fly processing and customizable components. We introduce Trove, an easy-to-use open-sourceretrieval toolkitthat\nsimplifies research experiments without sacrificing flexibility or speed. For\nthe first time, we introduce efficientdata managementfeatures that load and\nprocess (filter, select, transform, and combine) retrieval datasets on the fly,\nwith just a few lines of code. This gives users the flexibility to easily\nexperiment with differentdataset configurationswithout the need to compute\nand store multiple copies of large datasets. Trove is highly customizable: in\naddition to many built-in options, it allows users to freely modify existing\ncomponents or replace them entirely with user-defined objects. It also provides\na low-code and unified pipeline for evaluation andhard negative mining, which\nsupportsmulti-node executionwithout any code changes. Trove'sdata managementfeatures reduce memory consumption by a factor of 2.6. Moreover, Trove's\neasy-to-useinference pipelineincurs no overhead, and inference times decrease\nlinearly with the number of available nodes. Most importantly, we demonstrate\nhow Trove simplifies retrieval experiments and allows for arbitrary\ncustomizations, thus facilitating exploratory research.
