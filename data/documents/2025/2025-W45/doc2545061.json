  "context": "TWIST2, a portable mocap-free system, enables efficient data collection and hierarchical visuomotor policy control for humanoid robots. Large-scale data has driven breakthroughs in robotics, from language models\nto vision-language-action models in bimanual manipulation. However, humanoid\nrobotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid\nteleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive\nmotion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid\nteleoperation and data collection system that preserves fullwhole-body controlwhile advancing scalability. Our system leveragesPICO4U VRfor obtaining\nreal-time whole-body human motions, with a custom 2-DoF robot neck (cost around\n$250) foregocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control. We\ndemonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can\ncollect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate.\nBuilding on this pipeline, we propose ahierarchical visuomotor policyframework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric\nvision. Our visuomotor policy successfully demonstrates whole-body dexterous\nmanipulation anddynamic kicking tasks. The entire system is fully reproducible\nand open-sourced at https://yanjieze.com/TWIST2 . Our collected dataset is also\nopen-sourced at https://twist-data.github.io .
