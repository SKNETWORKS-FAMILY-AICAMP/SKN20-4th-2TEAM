  "context": "Cosmos-Predict2.5 and Cosmos-Transfer2.5 are advanced Physical AI models that unify text, image, and video generation, improve video quality and instruction alignment, and enable Sim2Real and Real2Real world translation with higher fidelity. We introduce [Cosmos-Predict2.5], the latest generation of the Cosmos World\nFoundation Models forPhysical AI. Built on aflow-based architecture,\n[Cosmos-Predict2.5] unifiesText2World,Image2World, andVideo2Worldgeneration\nin a single model and leverages [Cosmos-Reason1], aPhysical AIvision-language\nmodel, to provide richer text grounding and finer control of world simulation.\nTrained on 200M curated video clips and refined with reinforcement\nlearning-based post-training, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] achieves substantial\nimprovements over [Cosmos-Predict1] in video quality and instruction alignment,\nwith models released at 2B and 14B scales. These capabilities enable more\nreliablesynthetic data generation,policy evaluation, and closed-loop\nsimulation forroboticsandautonomous systems. We further extend the family\nwith [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], acontrol-netstyle framework forSim2RealandReal2Realworld translation. Despite being 3.5times smaller than\n[Cosmos-Transfer1], it delivers higher fidelity and robust long-horizon video\ngeneration. Together, these advances establish [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and\n[Cosmos-Transfer2.5] as versatile tools for scalingembodied intelligence. To\naccelerate research and deployment inPhysical AI, we release source code,\npretrained checkpoints, and curated benchmarks under the NVIDIA Open Model\nLicense at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5 and\nhttps://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5. We hope these open\nresources lower the barrier to adoption and foster innovation in building the\nnext generation ofembodied intelligence.
