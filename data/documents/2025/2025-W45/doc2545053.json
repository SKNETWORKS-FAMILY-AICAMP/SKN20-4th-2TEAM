  "context": "LiveTradeBench evaluates LLMs in dynamic trading environments to assess decision-making under real-time uncertainty and market volatility. Large language models(LLMs) achieve strong performance across\nbenchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but\nthese tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty.\nConsequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than\ndecision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce\nLiveTradeBench, alive trading environmentfor evaluating LLM agents in\nrealistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:\n(i) Live data streaming ofmarket pricesandnews, eliminating dependence on\noffline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing\nreal-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends\ncontrol from single-asset actions tomulti-asset allocation, integrating risk\nmanagement andcross-asset reasoning; and (iii)multi-market evaluationacross\nstructurally distinct environments--U.S. stocksand Polymarket prediction\nmarkets--differing involatility,liquidity, andinformation flow. At each\nstep, an agent observes prices,news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21LLMsacross families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) someLLMseffectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These\nfindings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,\nmotivating benchmarks that testsequential decision makingand consistency\nunder live uncertainty.
