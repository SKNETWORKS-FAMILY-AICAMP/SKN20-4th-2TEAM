  "context": "Brain-IT uses a Brain Interaction Transformer to reconstruct images from fMRI data with high fidelity, surpassing current methods and requiring less training data. Reconstructing images seen by people from theirfMRIbrain recordings\nprovides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress\nenabled bydiffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the\nactual seen images. We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that\naddresses this challenge through aBrain Interaction Transformer(BIT),\nallowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similarbrain-voxels. Thesefunctional-clustersare shared by all subjects, serving as\nbuilding blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All\nmodel components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient\ntraining with a limited amount of data. To guide theimage reconstruction,BITpredicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level\nsemantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic\ncontent of the image; and (ii)low-level structural featureswhich help to\ninitialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to\nlocalized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image\nreconstructions fromfMRIthat faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and\nsurpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective\nmetrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour offMRIdata from a new subject, we achieve\nresults comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings. Presents Brain-IT, a Brain-Interaction Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art fMRI-to-image reconstructions, reliably preserving the underlying visual content.Project page:https://amitzalcher.github.io/Brain-IT/ wow. This is insanely impressive, it captures the semantics so well. Next step is to try diffusion models with stronger semantic priors? That's a promising direction. Using a diffusion model with stronger priors, paired with effective conditioning signals that can be robustly predicted from fMRI. This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
