  "context": "RoboChallenge is an online evaluation system for robotic control algorithms, particularly VLA models, that addresses the need for large-scale testing with scalability and reproducibility. Testing on real machines is indispensable forrobotic control algorithms. In\nthe context of learning-based algorithms, especiallyVLA models, demand for\nlarge-scale evaluation, i.e. testing a large number of models on a large number\nof tasks, is becoming increasingly urgent. However, doing this right is highly\nnon-trivial, especially whenscalabilityandreproducibilityis taken into\naccount. In this report, we describe our methodology for constructingRoboChallenge, anonline evaluation systemto testrobotic control algorithms,\nand our survey of recent state-of-the-artVLA modelsusing our initialbenchmark Table30. RoboChallenge is an online evaluation system designed to scalably and reproducibly test learning-based robotic control algorithms, including state-of-the-art VLA models, on large-scale benchmarks.
