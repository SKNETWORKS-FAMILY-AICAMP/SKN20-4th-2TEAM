  "context": "HyperClick enhances GUI automation by calibrating confidence and reducing overconfidence through a dual reward mechanism and spatial confidence modeling. Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI\ngrounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to\nexecute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) orreinforcement fine-tuning(RFT), lack self-awareness of\ntheir capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable\npredictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized\nconfidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between\nconfidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI\nautomation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,\nwe propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliableGUI groundingthroughuncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces adual reward mechanism,\ncombining a binary reward for correct actions with atruncated Gaussian-based\nspatial confidence modeling, calibrated using theBrier score. This approach\njointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fosteringintrospective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge\nbenchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while\nproviding well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence\ncalibration andintrospective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence\nand supports more reliable GUI automation.
