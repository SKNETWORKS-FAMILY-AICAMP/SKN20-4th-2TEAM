  "context": "A one-stage text-to-image synthesis pipeline for X-ray security images improves efficiency and quality without extra labor cost, enhancing prohibited item detection performance. Trainingprohibited item detectionmodels requires a large amount of X-ray security images, but collecting and annotating these images is time-consuming and laborious. To address data insufficiency, X-ray security image synthesis methods composite images to scale up datasets. However, previous methods primarily follow a two-stage pipeline, where they implement labor-intensive foreground extraction in the first stage and then composite images in the second stage. Such a pipeline introduces inevitable extra labor cost and is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a one-stage X-ray security image synthesis pipeline (Xsyn) based ontext-to-image generation, which incorporates two effective strategies to improve the usability of synthetic images. The Cross-Attention Refinement (CAR) strategy leverages thecross-attention mapfrom thediffusion modelto refine thebounding box annotation. TheBackground Occlusion Modeling(BOM) strategy explicitly models background occlusion in thelatent spaceto enhance imaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, compared with previous methods, Xsyn is the first to achieve high-quality X-ray security image synthesis without extra labor cost. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all previous methods with 1.2%mAPimprovement, and the synthetic images generated by our method are beneficial to improveprohibited item detectionperformance across various X-ray security datasets and detectors.
