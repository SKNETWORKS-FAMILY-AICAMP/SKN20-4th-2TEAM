  "context": "A framework leveraging Computer-Use Agents as judges to assist coding-oriented language models in designing efficient and functional GUIs. Computer-Use Agents(CUA) are becoming increasingly capable of autonomously operating digital environments throughGraphical User Interfaces(GUI). Yet, mostGUIremain designed primarily for humans--prioritizing aesthetics and usability--forcing agents to adopt human-oriented behaviors that are unnecessary for efficient task execution. At the same time, rapid advances in coding-orientedlanguage models(Coder) have transformed automaticGUIdesign. This raises a fundamental question: CanCUAas judges to assistCoderfor automaticGUIdesign? To investigate, we introduceAUI-Gym, a benchmark for AutomaticGUIdevelopment spanning 52 applications across diverse domains. Usinglanguage models, we synthesize 1560 tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. To ensuretask reliability, we further develop a verifier that programmatically checks whether each task is executable within its environment. Building on this, we propose aCoder-CUAin Collaboration framework: theCoderacts as Designer, generating and revising websites, while theCUAserves as Judge, evaluating functionality and refining designs. Success is measured not by visual appearance, but bytask solvabilityandCUAnavigation success rate. To turnCUAfeedback into usableguidance, we design aCUA Dashboardthat compresses multi-step navigation histories into concise visual summaries, offering interpretableguidance for iterative redesign. By positioning agents as both designers and judges, our framework shifts interface design toward agent-native efficiency and reliability. Our work takes a step toward shifting agents from passive use toward active participation in digital environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/showlab/AUI. Are UI designed for 🧑🏻‍💻 humans actually suitable for 🤖 Agents? TL;DR:Can Computer-Use Agents offer feedback to assist Coders to Generate UI? and can we buildAgent-friendly UI (AUI)?  📄arxiv:https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15567🌐website:https://showlab.github.io/AUI/🧑‍💻github:https://github.com/showlab/AUI/🐙demo:https://huggingface.co/spaces/showlab/AUI This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
