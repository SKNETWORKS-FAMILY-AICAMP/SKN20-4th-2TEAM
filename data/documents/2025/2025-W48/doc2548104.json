  "context": "Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS) improves vision-language model performance by flexibly curating training data based on specific concept distributions. What data should a vision-language model be trained on? To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution isDataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building onDataConcept, we introduceConcept-Aware Batch Sampling(CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions. We propose two variants: (i)Diversity Maximization(CABS-DM) to curate batches with a broad coverage of available concepts, and (ii)Frequency Maximization(CABS-FM) to curate batches with high object multiplicity. Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that ourCABSmethod significantly benefitsCLIP/SigLIPmodel classes and yields highly performant models. Overall,CABSrepresents a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online data curation algorithms, enabling practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks.
