  "context": "FaraGen creates synthetic datasets for computer use agents, enabling the training of efficient and high-performing models like Fara-7B on diverse web tasks, outperforming larger models on benchmarks. Progress in computer use agents (CUAs) has been constrained by the absence of large and high-quality datasets that capture how humans interact with a computer. While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists forCUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduceFaraGen, a novelsynthetic data generationsystem formulti-step web tasks.FaraGencan propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multipleverifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity formulti-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to trainFara-7B, anative CUA modelthat perceives the computer using onlyscreenshots, executes actions viapredicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find thatFara-7Boutperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks likeWebVoyager,Online-Mind2Web, andWebTailBench-- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore,Fara-7Bis competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models. We are makingFara-7Bopen-weight on Microsoft Foundry and HuggingFace, and we are releasingWebTailBench.
