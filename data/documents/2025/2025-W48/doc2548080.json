  "context": "OmniScientist is a framework that simulates human scientific processes to automate and enhance AI-driven scientific research through structured knowledge systems, collaborative protocols, and evaluation platforms. With the rapid development ofLarge Language Models(LLMs), AI agents have demonstrated increasing proficiency in scientific tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experimental design to manuscript writing. Such agent systems are commonly referred to as \"AI Scientists.\" However, existingAI Scientistspredominantly formulatescientific discoveryas a standalone search oroptimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed ofcollaborative mechanisms,contribution attribution,peer review, andstructured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduceOmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow.OmniScientistnot only achieves end-to-end automation acrossdata foundation,literature review,research ideation,experiment automation,scientific writing, andpeer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) astructured knowledge systembuilt uponcitation networksandconceptual correlations; (2) acollaborative research protocol(OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) anopen evaluation platform(ScienceArena) based onblind pairwise user votingandElo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.
