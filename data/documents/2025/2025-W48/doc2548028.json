  "context": "Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT) enables Vision-Language Models to reason through visual tokens, improving their performance on perceptual tasks by capturing dense visual information. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capturedense visual informationacrossspatial dimensions. We introduceChain-of-Visual-Thought(COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also throughcontinuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens,COVTdistills knowledge fromlightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as2D appearance,3D geometry,spatial layout, andedge structure. During training, the VLM withCOVTautoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstructdense supervision signals(e.g.,depth,segmentation,edges, andDINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, includingCV-Bench,MMVP,RealWorldQA,MMStar,WorldMedQA, andHRBench, integratingCOVTinto strong VLMs such asQwen2.5-VLandLLaVAconsistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretablemultimodal intelligence.

It feels like letting the LLM automatically invoke four different tools and leverage their outputs to enhance model performance. I believe this would definitely improve the model's effectiveness. What I think needs to be proven is whether it's better for the LLM to generate function calls or to generate continuous visual tokens. This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
