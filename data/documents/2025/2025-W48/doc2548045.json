  "context": "M-GRPO, an extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization for hierarchical multi-agent systems, improves stability and efficiency in tool-augmented reasoning tasks by aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling agent training. Multi-agent systemsperform well on general reasoning tasks. However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unifiedlarge language model (LLM)for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, trainingmulti-agent systemswith distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension ofGroup Relative Policy Optimizationdesigned for verticalMulti-agent systemswith a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaininghierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces atrajectory-alignment schemethat generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy adecoupled training pipelinein which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via ashared store. This enables scalable training withoutcross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhancestool-augmented reasoning tasks.
