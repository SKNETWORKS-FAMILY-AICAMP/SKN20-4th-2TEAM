  "context": "iMontage repurposes pre-trained video models to generate high-quality, diverse image sets with natural transitions and enhanced dynamics through a unified framework and tailored adaptation strategy. Pre-trained video modelslearn powerful priors for generating high-quality, temporally coherent content. While these models excel attemporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by thecontinuous natureof their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrainedcontent diversityfromimage datainto this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduceiMontage, aunified frameworkdesigned to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-oneimage generator. The framework consumes and producesvariable-length image sets, unifying a wide array ofimage generationand editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasiveadaptation strategy, complemented by a tailoreddata curationprocess andtraining paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broadimage manipulationcapabilities without corrupting its invaluable originalmotion priors.iMontageexcels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strongcross-image contextual consistencybut also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.
