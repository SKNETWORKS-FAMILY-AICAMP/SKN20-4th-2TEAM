  "context": "ReDirector uses a novel camera-controlled video retake method with Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE) to improve dynamic object localization and static background preservation in variable-length videos. We present ReDirector, a novelcamera-controlled video retakegeneration method for dynamically captured variable-length videos. In particular, we rectify a common misuse ofRoPEin previous works by aligning thespatiotemporal positionsof the input video and the target retake. Moreover, we introduceRotary Camera Encoding(RoCE), a camera-conditionedRoPEphase shift that captures and integratesmulti-view relationshipswithin and across the input and target videos. By integrating camera conditions intoRoPE, our method generalizes to out-of-distribution camera trajectories and video lengths, yielding improveddynamic object localizationandstatic background preservation. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements incamera controllability,geometric consistency, andvideo qualityacross various trajectories and lengths.
