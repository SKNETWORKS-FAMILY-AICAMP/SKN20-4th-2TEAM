  "context": "MagicWorld, an interactive video world model, integrates 3D geometry and historical retrieval to improve scene stability and continuity under user instructions. Recent interactive video world model methods generatescene evolutionconditioned on user instructions. Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates3D geometric priorsandhistorical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drivedynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce theAction-Guided 3D Geometry Module(AG3D), which constructs apoint cloudfrom the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints forviewpoint transitionsand thereby improving structural consistency. We further proposeHistory Cache Retrieval(HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations.
