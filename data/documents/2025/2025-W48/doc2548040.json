  "context": "Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on diverse imaging datasets, outperforms existing models across various tasks and extends to new applications using RATE for label extraction. Radiology plays an integral role in modern medicine, yet rising imaging volumes have far outpaced workforce growth.Foundation modelsoffer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they processvolumetric CTandMRIas low-fidelity 2D slices, discard criticalgrayscale contrastinformation, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice. We introduce Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breastMRIs from a large academic center, together withRATE, a scalable framework that extractsstructured labelsfor 366 radiologic findings with near-perfect accuracy using LLMs. Across internal test sets of 14,230 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 10,646 chest CTs, 4,906 head CTs, and 1,585 breastMRIs, Pillar-0 establishes a new performance frontier, achieving meanAUROCs of 86.4, 88.0, 90.1, and 82.9, outperformingMedGemma(Google),MedImageInsight(Microsoft),Lingshu(Alibaba), andMerlin(Stanford) by 7.8-15.8AUROCpoints and ranking best in 87.2\\% (319/366) tasks. Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on theStanford Abdominal CT dataset, includingMerlin(82.2 vs 80.6AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such aslong-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-artSybilby 3.0C-indexpoints on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). Inbrain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a >95AUROCwhen using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline. Pillar-0 andRATEtogether provide anopen,clinically rigorousfoundation for building high-performance radiology systems, enabling applications that were previously infeasible due to computational, data, and evaluation constraints. We introduce Pillar-0, a new radiology foundation model trained on over 150,000 volumetric CT and MRI scans, alongside RATE, an automated framework for labeling clinical findings. Pillar-0 significantly outperforms major competitor models (including those from Google, Microsoft, and Stanford) across 366 tasks, demonstrating superior accuracy, generalization, and extreme data efficiency in detecting conditions like brain hemorrhages and predicting lung cancer risk.  📜 ArXiv:https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17803🌐 Website:https://yalalab.github.io/pillar-0/🤗 Model:https://huggingface.co/collections/YalaLab/pillar-0🏗️ Pillar-Pretrain:https://github.com/YalaLab/pillar-pretrain🎛️ Pillar-Finetune:https://github.com/YalaLab/pillar-finetune🩻 Radiology-Vision-Engine:https://github.com/YalaLab/rave🛠️ Rate:https://github.com/YalaLab/rate📊 Rate-Evals:https://github.com/YalaLab/rate-evals This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
