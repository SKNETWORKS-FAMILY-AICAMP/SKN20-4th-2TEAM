  "context": "Segment Anything Model 3 achieves state-of-the-art performance in promptable concept segmentation and tracking by leveraging a unified model architecture with decoupled recognition and localization. We presentSegment Anything Model(SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based onconcept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., \"yellow school bus\"), image exemplars, or a combination of both.Promptable Concept Segmentation(PCS) takes such prompts and returnssegmentation masksandunique identitiesfor all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build ascalable data enginethat produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of animage-level detectorand amemory-based video trackerthat share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with apresence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities onvisual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark forpromptable concept segmentation.
