  "context": "Forecasting performance of Large Language Models varies significantly across different domains and question types, influenced by context and external knowledge. Large Language Models(LLMs) demonstrate partialforecasting competenceacross social, political, and economic events. Yet, their predictive ability varies sharply withdomain structureandprompt framing. We investigate how forecasting performance varies with differentmodel familiesonreal-world questionsabout events that happened beyond themodel cutoff date. We analyze howcontext,question type, andexternal knowledgeaffectaccuracyandcalibration, and how adding factual newscontextmodifiesbelief formationandfailure modes. Our results show that forecasting ability is highly variable as it depends on what, and how, we ask. LLMs forecasting ability on real world questions from prediction markets (such as polymarket) varies significantly by category. While addition of news helps, it also adds certain failure modes such as definition drift, recency bias and rumour anchoring This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
