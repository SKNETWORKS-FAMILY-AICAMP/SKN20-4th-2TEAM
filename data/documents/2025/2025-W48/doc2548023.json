  "context": "UniSandbox evaluates Unified Multimodal Models, revealing a gap between understanding and generation, and identifies Chain-of-Thought and self-training as means to bridge this gap. Recent years have witnessed significant progress inUnified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduceUniSandbox, adecoupled evaluation frameworkpaired with controlled,synthetic datasetsto avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significantunderstanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions:reasoning generationandknowledge transfer. Specifically, forreasoning generationtasks, we observe that explicitChain-of-Thought(CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that aself-trainingapproach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, forknowledge transfertasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover thatquery-based architecturesinherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer.UniSandboxprovides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.
