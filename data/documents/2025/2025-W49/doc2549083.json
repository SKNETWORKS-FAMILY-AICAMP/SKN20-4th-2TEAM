We present Jina-VLM, a 2.4B parameter vision-language model that achieves state-of-the-artmultilingual visual question answeringamong open 2B-scale VLMs. The model couples aSigLIP2vision encoder with aQwen3language backbone through anattention-pooling connectorthat enablestoken-efficient processingofarbitrary-resolution images. Across standardVQA benchmarksand multilingual evaluations, Jina-VLM outperforms comparable models while preserving competitivetext-only performance. our latest multilingual vlm model at 2b size, about to release soon we take 2 apache-2.0 components, combine them and release as cc-by-nc Bravo.
