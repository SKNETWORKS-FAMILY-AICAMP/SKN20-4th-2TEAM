  "context": "R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework, enables stable and controllable model self-evolution with minimal human supervision, achieving performance improvements on math and reasoning benchmarks. AIself-evolutionhas long been envisioned as a path towardsuperintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such asconcept drift,diversity collapse, andmis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduceR-Few, a guidedSelf-Play Challenger-Solverframework that incorporates lightweight human oversight throughin-context groundingandmixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guidesynthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks,R-Fewachieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example,Qwen3-8B-Baseimproves by +3.0 points overR-Zeroon math tasks and achieves performance on par withGeneral-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data.Ablation studiesconfirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows thatR-Fewmitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllableco-evolutionary dynamics.
