  "context": "The paper introduces Reward Forcing, which enhances video generation by updating sink tokens with EMA-Sink and using Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation to prioritize dynamic content. Efficientstreaming video generationis critical for simulating interactive and dynamic worlds. Existing methods distill few-stepvideo diffusion modelswithsliding window attention, using initial frames assink tokensto maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminishedmotion dynamics. To address this, we introduceReward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we proposeEMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens viaexponential moving averageas they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost,EMA-Sinktokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distillmotion dynamicsfrom teacher models, we propose a novelRewarded Distribution Matching Distillation(Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead,Re-DMDbiases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by avision-language model.Re-DMDsignificantly enhances motion quality while preservingdata fidelity. We include both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show thatReward Forcingachieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while enabling high-qualitystreaming video generationat 23.1 FPS on a single H100 GPU. homepage:https://reward-forcing.github.io/ Good paper!
