  "context": "A self-verifying large language model for theorem proving improves mathematical reasoning by incentivizing rigorous step-by-step derivations and achieves high scores in international competitions. Large language modelshave made significant progress inmathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning withreinforcement learningthat rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturatingquantitative reasoning competitionslike AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higherfinal answer accuracydoesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks liketheorem provingrequire rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor ofmathematical reasoning.Self-verificationis particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiablemathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier fortheorem proving. We then train aproof generatorusing the verifier as thereward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scaleverification computeto automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strongtheorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores onIMO2025 andCMO2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 onPutnam2024 with scaled test-time compute. The DeepSeekMath-V2 paper introduces a new self-verifying mathematical reasoning model that generates and validates its own proofs, achieving top performance on Olympiad-level benchmarks.
