  "context": "SimWorld, a new Unreal Engine 5-based simulator, enables the development and evaluation of LLM/VLM agents in realistic, real-world-like settings with diverse physical and social reasoning scenarios. WhileLLM/VLM-poweredAI agentshave advanced rapidly in math, coding, and computer use, their applications in complex physical and social environments remain challenging. Building agents that can survive and thrive in the real world (for example, by autonomously earning income or running a business) requires massive-scale interaction, reasoning, training, and evaluation across diverse embodied scenarios. However, existing world simulators for such development fall short: they often rely on limited hand-crafted environments, simulate simplified game-like physics and social rules, and lack native support forLLM/VLMagents. We introduce SimWorld, a new simulator built onUnreal Engine 5, designed for developing and evaluatingLLM/VLMagents in rich, real-world-like settings. SimWorld offers three core capabilities: (1) realistic, open-endedworld simulation, including accurate physical and social dynamics and language-drivenprocedural environment generation; (2) a rich interface forLLM/VLMagents, with multimodal world inputs andopen-vocabulary actionsat varying levels of abstraction; and (3) diverse and extensible physical and socialreasoning scenariosthat are easily customizable by users. We demonstrate SimWorld by deploying frontierLLMagents (e.g.,GPT-4o,Gemini-2.5-Flash,Claude-3.5, andDeepSeek-Prover-V2) on long-horizonmulti-agent delivery tasksinvolvingstrategic cooperationandcompetition. The results reveal distinct reasoning patterns and limitations across models. We open-source SimWorld and hope it becomes a foundational platform for advancing real-world agent intelligence across disciplines: https://simworld.org.  Hi!
