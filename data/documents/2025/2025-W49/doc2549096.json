  "context": "TRivia, a self-supervised fine-tuning method, enables pretrained vision-language models to learn table recognition from unlabeled data using a question-answering-based reward mechanism, outperforming existing models on popular benchmarks. Table recognition(TR) aims to transform table images into semi-structured representations such as HTML or Markdown. As a core component of document parsing, TR has long relied on supervised learning, with recent efforts dominated by fine-tuningvision-language models(VLMs) using labeled data. While VLMs have brought TR to the next level, pushing performance further demands large-scale labeled data that is costly to obtain. Consequently, although proprietary models have continuously pushed the performance boundary, open-source models, often trained with limited resources and, in practice, the only viable option for many due to privacy regulations, still lag far behind. To bridge this gap, we introduceTRivia, aself-supervised fine-tuningmethod that enables pretrained VLMs to learn TR directly from unlabeled table images in the wild. Built uponGroup Relative Policy Optimization,TRiviaautomatically identifies unlabeled samples that most effectively facilitate learning and eliminates the need for human annotations through aquestion-answering-based reward mechanism. Anattention-guided modulegenerates diverse questions for each table image, and the ability to interpret the recognition results and answer them correctly provides feedback to optimize the TR model. This closed-loop process allows the TR model to autonomously learn to recognize, structure, and reason over tables without labeled data. Leveraging this pipeline, we presentTRivia-3B, an open-sourced, compact, and state-of-the-art TR model that surpasses existing systems (e.g.,Gemini 2.5 Pro,MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks.
