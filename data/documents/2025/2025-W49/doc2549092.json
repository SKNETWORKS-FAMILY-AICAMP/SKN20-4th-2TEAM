  "context": "LATTICE, a new framework, uses VoxSet to generate high-fidelity 3D assets efficiently with a two-stage pipeline involving a rectified flow transformer. We present LATTICE, a new framework for high-fidelity 3D asset generation that bridges the quality and scalability gap between 3D and 2D generative models. While 2D image synthesis benefits from fixed spatial grids and well-established transformer architectures, 3D generation remains fundamentally more challenging due to the need to predict both spatial structure and detailed geometric surfaces from scratch. These challenges are exacerbated by the computational complexity of existing 3D representations and the lack of structured and scalable 3D asset encoding schemes. To address this, we proposeVoxSet, a semi-structured representation that compresses 3D assets into a compact set oflatent vectorsanchored to a coarsevoxel grid, enabling efficient and position-aware generation.VoxSetretains the simplicity and compression advantages of prior VecSet methods while introducing explicit structure into the latent space, allowingpositional embeddingsto guide generation and enabling strong token-level test-time scaling. Built upon this representation, LATTICE adopts a two-stage pipeline: first generating a sparse voxelized geometry anchor, then producing detailed geometry using arectified flow transformer. Our method is simple at its core, but supports arbitrary resolution decoding, low-cost training, and flexible inference schemes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various aspects, and offering a significant step toward scalable, high-quality 3D asset creation. 3D Shape foundation model This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
