  "context": "PosterCopilot enhances professional graphic design through a three-stage training strategy for LMMs, enabling geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts with controllable iterative editing. Graphic design forms the cornerstone of modern visual communication, serving as a vital medium for promoting cultural and commercial events. Recent advances have explored automating this process usingLarge Multimodal Models(LMMs), yet existing methods often produce geometrically inaccurate layouts and lack the iterative, layer-specific editing required in professional workflows. To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equipsLMMswith geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting ofPerturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning,Reinforcement LearningforVisual-Reality Alignment, andReinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model withgenerative models, enablinglayer-controllable,iterative editingfor precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosterCopilot achieves geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts, offering unprecedented controllability for professional iterative design.
