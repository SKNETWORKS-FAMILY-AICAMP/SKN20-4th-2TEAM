  "context": "PromptBridge is a framework that facilitates prompt transfer between different LLMs to maintain performance without re-optimization. Large language models (LLMs)underpin applications incode generation,mathematical reasoning, andagent-based workflows. In practice, systems access LLMs viacommercial APIsoropen-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenonModel Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show thatmodel driftingis both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introducePromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization.PromptBridgerequires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first appliesModel-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE)to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models,PromptBridgelearns across-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show thatPromptBridgeconsistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon.

For example, when transferring from the sourcemodel to the target model, such as o3, PromptBridge yields a 27.39% improvement on SWE-Bench and a 39.44% improvement on Terminal-Bench relative to direct transfer. These results establish cross-model prompt transferability as a critical requirement for sustainable LLM system developmentand demonstrate that PromptBridge is an effective, practical, training-free solution for maintaining performance as models evolve.
