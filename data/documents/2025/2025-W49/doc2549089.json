  "context": "A model-based approach combining Bayesian optimization and Monte Carlo Tree Search improves upper bounds for sphere packing in dimensions 4-16 by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process. Sphere packing,Hilbert's eighteenth problem, asks for the densest arrangement of congruent spheres in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension n=8, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precisionsemidefinite programs(SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combinesBayesian optimisationwithMonte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions 4-16, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration. AlphaEvolve is amazing and tackles hard-to-solve and easy-to-evaluate problems! But, many math problems are actually hard-to-solve and hard-to-evaluate! Here, we can't do much trial and error; we need something more efficient - because trying one solution can take DAYS! We propose a framework for that and use it in sphere packing; Hilbert's 18th problem! We recover new bounds not known before! 🥳🥳 The amazing part is we don't use LLMs! We used model-based search!
