  "context": "DynamicVerse is a framework that models dynamic real-world videos by integrating large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to produce a comprehensive 4D multimodal dataset, achieving superior performance in video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation. Understanding the dynamic physical world, characterized by its evolving 3D structure, real-world motion, and semantic content with textual descriptions, is crucial for human-agent interaction and enables embodied agents to perceive and act within real environments with human-like capabilities. However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduceDynamicVerse, a physical-scale,multimodal 4D world modelingframework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-basedBundle Adjustmentwithglobal optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format.DynamicVersedelivers a large-scale dataset consisting of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namelyvideo depth estimation,camera pose estimation, andcamera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.
