  "context": "DeepSeek-V3.2 introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention and a scalable reinforcement learning framework, achieving superior reasoning and performance compared to GPT-5 and Gemini-3.0-Pro in complex reasoning tasks. We introduce DeepSeek-V3.2, a model that harmonizes highcomputational efficiencywith superior reasoning and agent performance. The key technical breakthroughs of DeepSeek-V3.2 are as follows: (1)DeepSeek Sparse Attention(DSA): We introduceDSA, an efficient attention mechanism that substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance inlong-context scenarios. (2) ScalableReinforcement Learning Framework: By implementing a robust reinforcement learning protocol and scaling post-training compute, DeepSeek-V3.2 performs comparably to GPT-5. Notably, our high-compute variant, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, surpasses GPT-5 and exhibitsreasoning proficiencyon par with Gemini-3.0-Pro, achievinggold-medal performancein both the 2025International Mathematical Olympiad(IMO) and theInternational Olympiad in Informatics(IOI). (3) Large-ScaleAgentic Task Synthesis Pipeline: To integrate reasoning into tool-use scenarios, we developed a novel synthesis pipeline that systematically generates training data at scale. This methodology facilitates scalable agentic post-training, yielding substantial improvements in generalization and instruction-following robustness within complex, interactive environments.
