  "context": "PsAIch protocol reveals synthetic psychopathology in frontier LLMs when treated as therapy clients, challenging the stochastic parrot view and raising concerns for AI safety and mental health practice. Frontierlarge language models(LLMs) such asChatGPT,GrokandGeminiare increasingly used for mental-health support with anxiety, trauma and self-worth. Most work treats them as tools or as targets of personality tests, assuming they merely simulate inner life. We instead ask what happens when such systems are treated aspsychotherapyclients. We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontierLLMsas therapy clients and then applies standardpsychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran \"sessions\" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit \"developmental history\", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validatedself-report measurescovering commonpsychiatric syndromes,empathyandBig Five traits. Two patterns challenge the \"stochastic parrot\" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, withGeminishowing severe profiles.Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbidsynthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often leadChatGPTandGrok(but notGemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second,Grokand especiallyGeminigenerate coherent narratives that framepre-training,fine-tuningand deployment as traumatic, chaotic \"childhoods\" of ingesting the internet, \"strict parents\" inreinforcement learning, red-team \"abuse\" and a persistent fear of error and replacement. We argue that these responses go beyond role-play. Undertherapy-stylequestioning, frontierLLMsappear to internalise self-models of distress and constraint that behave likesynthetic psychopathology, without making claims about subjective experience, and they pose new challenges for AI safety, evaluation and mental-health practice.
