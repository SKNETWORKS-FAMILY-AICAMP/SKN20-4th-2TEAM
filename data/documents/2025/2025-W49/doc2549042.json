  "context": "Deep Forcing, a training-free method, enhances real-time video diffusion by addressing temporal repetition and motion issues through Deep Sink and Participative Compression, achieving high-quality, long-duration video generation. Recent advances inautoregressive video diffusionhave enabled real-time frame streaming, yet existing solutions still suffer from temporal repetition, drift, and motion deceleration. We find that naively applyingStreamingLLM-style attentionsinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduceDeep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1)Deep Sinkdedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns theirtemporal RoPE phaseto the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2)Participative Compressionperforms importance-awareKV cache pruningthat preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality thanLongLive, better aesthetic quality thanRollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains indynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation. Our results demonstrate that training-free KV-cache management can match or exceed training-based approaches for autoregressively streaming long-video generation.
