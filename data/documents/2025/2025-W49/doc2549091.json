  "context": "Light-X is a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control, outperforming existing methods in joint camera-illumination control and relighting. Recent advances in illumination control extend image-based methods to video, yet still facing a trade-off between lighting fidelity and temporal consistency. Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we presentLight-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose adisentangled designthat decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured viadynamic point cloudsprojected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by arelit frameconsistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduceLight-Syn, adegradation-based pipelinewithinverse-mappingthat synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, andAI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show thatLight-Xoutperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings.
