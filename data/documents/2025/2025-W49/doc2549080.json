  "context": "SignRoundV2, a post-training quantization framework, achieves competitive accuracy for Large Language Models at extremely low-bit quantization through layer-wise bit allocation and pre-tuning scale search. Extremelow-bit quantizationis critical for efficiently deployingLarge Language Models(LLMs), yet it often leads to severe performance degradation at 2-bits and even 4-bits (e.g., MXFP4). We presentSignRoundV2, apost-training quantizationframework that is highly effective even withoutmixed-precision.SignRoundV2introduces (1) a fast sensitivity metric that combinesgradient informationwithquantization-induced deviationsto guidelayer-wise bit allocation, and (2) a lightweightpre-tuningsearch for quantization scales to improve extremelylow-bit quantization. These components allowSignRoundV2to close the gap with full-precision models. Extensive experiments indicate that our method sustains competitive accuracy for LLMs, achievingproduction-grade performancewith about 1 percent variance at 4-5 bits and strong results even at 2 bits.
