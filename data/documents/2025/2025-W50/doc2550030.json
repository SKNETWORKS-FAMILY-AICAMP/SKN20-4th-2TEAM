  "context": "Adapting autoregressive models to block-wise diffusion enables parallel generation and retains pretrained knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance among 7B-class diffusion language models. Large language models(LLMs) excel at generation but dominant autoregressive (AR) decoding is inherently sequential, creating a throughput bottleneck.Diffusion Language Models(DLMs)--especiallyblock-wise variants--enableparallel generationandintra-block bidirectional reasoning, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly and wastes the knowledge in mature AR checkpoints. Prior \"adaptation\" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to full-sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a block-diffusion recipe, leaving a fundamental mismatch between AR causality and block-wise bidirectionality unaddressed. We reframe adaptation as a intra-paradigm path from AR to Block-Diffusion by viewing AR as Block-Diffusion with blocksize=1. Concretely, we design the pathway of adaptation as follows: we use acontext-causal attention mask(causal in context, bidirectional only within the active block), an efficientparallel adaptation procedure, anauxiliary AR lossto maximize data utilization and retain pretrained knowledge, and gradual increment of the generation block size. The recipe integrates cleanly withmasked block-diffusionand maintainstrain-inference consistency. Built on these components,NBDiff-7B(Base and Instruct) could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs, delivering strong gains on general-knowledge, math, and code benchmarks over strong baselines. These results demonstrate that principled AR-to-block-diffusion adaptation is an effective and compute-efficient alternative to training DLMs from scratch.
