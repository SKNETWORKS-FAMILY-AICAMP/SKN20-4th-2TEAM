  "context": "A benchmark framework evaluates Vision-Language Models in understanding microscopic spatial relationships, showing potential but highlighting the need for domain-specific knowledge integration. This paper introduces the concept ofMicroscopic Spatial Intelligence(MiSI), the capability to perceive and reason about the spatial relationships of invisible microscopic entities, which is fundamental to scientific discovery. To assess the potential ofVision-Language Models(VLMs) in this domain, we propose a systematic benchmark frameworkMiSI-Bench. This framework features over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures, covering nine complementary tasks that evaluate abilities ranging from elementaryspatial transformationsto complexrelational identifications. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-artVLMsperform significantly below human level on this benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks, while its poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks likehydrogen bond recognitionunderscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress towardscientific AGI.
