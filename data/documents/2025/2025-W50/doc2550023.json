  "context": "DMVAE explicitly aligns the encoder's latent distribution with a reference distribution, improving modeling efficiency and image synthesis fidelity compared to conventional VAEs. Most visual generative models compress images into alatent spacebefore applying diffusion or autoregressive modelling. Yet, existing approaches such asVAEsandfoundation model aligned encodersimplicitly constrain thelatent spacewithout explicitly shaping its distribution, making it unclear which types of distributions are optimal for modeling. We introduceDistribution-Matching VAE (DMVAE), which explicitly aligns the encoder's latent distribution with an arbitrary reference distribution via adistribution matching constraint. This generalizes beyond theGaussian priorof conventionalVAEs, enabling alignment with distributions derived from self-supervised features, diffusion noise, or other prior distributions. With DMVAE, we can systematically investigate which latent distributions are more conducive to modeling, and we find thatSSL-derived distributionsprovide an excellent balance between reconstruction fidelity and modeling efficiency, reachinggFIDequals 3.2 onImageNetwith only 64 training epochs. Our results suggest that choosing a suitable latent distribution structure (achieved viadistribution-level alignment), rather than relying on fixed priors, is key to bridging the gap between easy-to-model latents and high-fidelity image synthesis.
