  "context": "Saber is a scalable zero-shot framework for reference-to-video generation that uses video-text pairs to learn identity-consistent representations and outperforms models trained with explicit reference data. Reference-to-video (R2V) generationaims to synthesize videos that align with a text prompt while preserving the subject identity from reference images. However, current R2V methods are hindered by the reliance on explicit reference image-video-text triplets, whose construction is highly expensive and difficult to scale. We bypass this bottleneck by introducing Saber, a scalable zero-shot framework that requires no explicit R2V data. Trained exclusively on video-text pairs, Saber employs amasked training strategyand a tailoredattention-based model designto learn identity-consistent and reference-aware representations.Mask augmentationtechniques are further integrated to mitigate copy-paste artifacts common in reference-to-video generation. Moreover, Saber demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities across a varying number of references and achieves superior performance on theOpenS2V-Eval benchmarkcompared to methods trained with R2V data.
