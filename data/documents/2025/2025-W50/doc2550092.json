  "context": "The TAD benchmark evaluates Vision-Language Models on temporal understanding in autonomous driving footage, revealing substandard performance and proposing training-free solutions to improve accuracy. Temporal understanding in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge, even for recent state-of-the-art (SoTA)Vision-Language Models(VLMs). Prior work has introduced datasets and benchmarks aimed at improvingtemporal reasoning, but these have emphasized other video content, including sports, cooking, and movies. No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leveragesChain-of-Thought(CoT) andTCogMap, which incorporates anego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD. The benchmark and evaluation code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/vbdai/TAD{Hugging Face} and https://github.com/vbdi/tad_bench{Github}, respectively. This work introduces TAD, the first benchmark targeting temporal understanding in ego-centric autonomous-driving videos, evaluates SoTA VLMs, and boosts their performance with two training-free motion-reasoning methods (Scene-CoT and TCogMap).
