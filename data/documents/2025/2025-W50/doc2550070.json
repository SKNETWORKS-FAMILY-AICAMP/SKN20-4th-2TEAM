Understanding and reconstructing the complex geometry and motion of dynamic scenes from video remains a formidable challenge in computer vision. This paper introduces D4RT, a simple yet powerfulfeedforward modeldesigned to efficiently solve this task. D4RT utilizes aunified transformer architectureto jointly infer depth,spatio-temporal correspondence, and fullcamera parametersfrom a single video. Its core innovation is a novelquerying mechanismthat sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple,task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous methods across a wide spectrum of4D reconstructiontasks.
