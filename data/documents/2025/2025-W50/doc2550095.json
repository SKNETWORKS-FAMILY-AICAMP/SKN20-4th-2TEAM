  "context": "A spatiotemporal reasoning framework enhances multimodal large language models for video question answering by strategically scheduling tools to improve spatial and temporal understanding. Video Question Answering (VideoQA) task serves as a critical playground for evaluating whether foundation models can effectively perceive, understand, and reason about dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existingMultimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensibleVideo Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose aSpatiotemporal Reasoning Framework(STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. OurSTARframework enhancesGPT-4ousing lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain onVideoMMEand 4.6% onLongVideoBench. We believe that our proposedVideo ToolkitandSTARframework make an important step towards building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.
