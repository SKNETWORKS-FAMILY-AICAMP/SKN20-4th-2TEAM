  "context": "AV-SpeakerBench is a benchmark for evaluating speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in videos, highlighting the importance of audiovisual fusion in multimodal large language models. Multimodal large language models(MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduceAV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused onspeaker-centricaudiovisual reasoningin real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2)fusion-groundedquestion design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3)expert-curatedannotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that theGemini familyconsistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models,Qwen3-Omni-30Bapproaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weakeraudiovisual fusionrather than visual perception. We believeAV-SpeakerBenchestablishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grainedaudiovisual reasoningin future multimodal systems.

We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.  The keypoint is our question design where both human and model have to match the audio and visual to answer the question because we put both visual and audio information into the question itself.
