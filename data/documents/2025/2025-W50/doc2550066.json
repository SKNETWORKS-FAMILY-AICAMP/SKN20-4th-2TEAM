  "context": "A unified framework combines vision-language models and video generation to improve autonomous driving in complex scenarios by enhancing reasoning, trajectory planning, and video generation. Autonomous driving (AD) systems struggle in long-tail scenarios due to limited world knowledge and weak visual dynamic modeling. Existingvision-language-action(VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, whileworld model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unifiedUnderstanding-Generation-Planningframework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trainedVLMsandvideo generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance. Taking multi-frame observations and language instructions as input, it produces interpretablechain-of-thought reasoning,physically consistent trajectories, andcoherent future videos. We introduce a four-stage training strategy that progressively builds these capabilities across multiple existing AD datasets, along with the proposed specialized datasets. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in perception, reasoning, and decision-making, with superior generalization to challenging long-tail situations. Proposes UniUGP, a unified framework integrating scene understanding, video generation, and trajectory planning for autonomous driving with visual reasoning.
