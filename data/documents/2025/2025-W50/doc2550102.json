  "context": "A large-scale dataset and multimodal model improve embodied interaction comprehension in robots by addressing perspective bias and enhancing multimodal signal integration. As robots enter human workspaces, there is a crucial need for them to comprehend embodied human instructions, enabling intuitive and fluent human-robot interaction (HRI). However, accurate comprehension is challenging due to a lack of large-scale datasets that capture natural embodied interactions in diverse HRI settings. Existing datasets suffer from perspective bias, single-view collection, inadequate coverage of nonverbal gestures, and a predominant focus on indoor environments. To address these issues, we present theRefer360dataset, a large-scale dataset of embodied verbal and nonverbal interactions collected across diverse viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor settings. Additionally, we introduceMuRes, amultimodal guided residual moduledesigned to improveembodied referring expression comprehension.MuResacts as aninformation bottleneck, extractingsalient modality-specific signalsand reinforcing them intopre-trained representationsto form complementary features for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on fourHRI datasets, including theRefer360dataset, and demonstrate that current multimodal models fail to capture embodied interactions comprehensively; however, augmenting them withMuResconsistently improves performance. These findings establishRefer360as a valuable benchmark and exhibit the potential of guided residual learning to advanceembodied referring expression comprehensionin robots operating within human environments. The paper introducesRefer360, a comprehensive multimodal dataset for embodied referring expression comprehension in human-robot interaction (HRI), and proposesMuRes, a lightweight guided residual module that selectively reinforces modality-specific features to improve multimodal grounding performance in real-world scenarios. ➡️𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐟𝐞𝐫𝟑𝟔𝟎 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤 + 𝐌𝐮𝐑𝐞𝐬 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞:🧠𝑹𝒆𝒇𝒆𝒓𝟑𝟔𝟎: 𝑭𝒊𝒓𝒔𝒕 𝑬𝒎𝒃𝒐𝒅𝒊𝒆𝒅 𝑹𝑬 𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒕 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑴𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒊-𝑽𝒊𝒆𝒘, 𝑴𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒊-𝑺𝒆𝒏𝒔𝒐𝒓 𝑴𝒐𝒅𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒊𝒆𝒔: Introduces a dataset with synchronizedegocentric and exocentric views,RGB, depth, infrared, 3D skeleton,eye gaze, andaudio, acrossindoor and outdoorenvironments.
