  "context": "StereoSpace uses viewpoint-conditioned diffusion to generate stereo images without explicit depth or warping, achieving superior performance on various scenes. We introduce StereoSpace, adiffusion-based frameworkformonocular-to-stereo synthesisthat models geometry purely throughviewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. Acanonical rectified spaceand the conditioning guide thegeneratorto infercorrespondencesand filldisocclusionsend-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce anend-to-end protocolthat excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance:iSQoEforperceptual comfortandMEt3Rforgeometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from thewarp & inpaint,latent-warping, andwarped-conditioningcategories, achievingsharp parallaxand strongrobustnesson layered andnon-Lambertian scenes. This establishesviewpoint-conditioned diffusionas a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.
