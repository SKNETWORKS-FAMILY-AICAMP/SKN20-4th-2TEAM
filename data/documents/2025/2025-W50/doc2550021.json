  "context": "DeepCode, a fully autonomous framework, addresses the challenges of document-to-codebase synthesis by optimizing information flow through source compression, structured indexing, knowledge injection, and error correction, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing human experts. Recent advances inlarge language models(LLMs) have given rise to powerfulcoding agents, making it possible for code assistants to evolve into code engineers. However, existing methods still face significant challenges in achieving high-fidelitydocument-to-codebase synthesis--such as scientific papers to code--primarily due to a fundamental conflict betweeninformation overloadand thecontext bottlenecksof LLMs. In this work, we introduceDeepCode, a fully autonomous framework that fundamentally addresses this challenge through principled information-flow management. By treating repository synthesis as achannel optimizationproblem,DeepCodeseamlessly orchestrates four information operations to maximize task-relevant signals under finite context budgets: source compression viablueprint distillation, structured indexing usingstateful code memory, conditional knowledge injection viaretrieval-augmented generation, andclosed-loop error correction. Extensive evaluations on thePaperBenchbenchmark demonstrate thatDeepCodeachieves state-of-the-art performance, decisively outperforming leading commercial agents such as Cursor and Claude Code, and crucially, surpassing PhD-level human experts from top institutes on key reproduction metrics. By systematically transforming paper specifications into production-grade implementations comparable to human expert quality, this work establishes new foundations forautonomous scientific reproductionthat can accelerate research evaluation and discovery.
