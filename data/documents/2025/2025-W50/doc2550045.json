  "context": "LongCat-Image is a bilingual open-source foundation model for image generation that addresses multilingual text rendering, photorealism, and deployment efficiency through rigorous data curation, compact design, and comprehensive open-source support. We introduce LongCat-Image, a pioneering open-source and bilingual (Chinese-English)foundation modelforimage generation, designed to address core challenges inmultilingual text rendering,photorealism,deployment efficiency, and developer accessibility prevalent in current leading models. 1) We achieve this through rigorousdata curationstrategies across the pre-training, mid-training, and SFT stages, complemented by the coordinated use of curatedreward modelsduring the RL phase. This strategy establishes the model as a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), delivering superior text-rendering capabilities and remarkablephotorealism, and significantly enhancing aesthetic quality. 2) Notably, it sets a new industry standard for Chinese character rendering. By supporting even complex and rare characters, it outperforms both major open-source and commercial solutions in coverage, while also achieving superior accuracy. 3) The model achieves remarkable efficiency through its compact design. With a corediffusion modelof only 6Bparameters, it is significantly smaller than the nearly 20B or largerMixture-of-Experts(MoE) architectures common in the field. This ensures minimalVRAM usageand rapidinference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Beyond generation, LongCat-Image also excels inimage editing, achieving SOTA results on standard benchmarks with superior editing consistency compared to other open-source works. 4) To fully empower the community, we have established the most comprehensiveopen-source ecosystemto date. We are releasing not only multiple model versions fortext-to-imageandimage editing, including checkpoints after mid-training and post-training stages, but also the entire toolchain oftraining procedure. We believe that the openness of LongCat-Image will provide robust support for developers and researchers, pushing the frontiers of visual content creation.
