  "context": "OmniVinci, an open-source omni-modal LLM, enhances cross-modal understanding and performance across audio, vision, and robotics applications with innovative architecture and efficient data curation. Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive\nacross multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce\nOmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We\ncarefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.\nFor model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i)OmniAlignNetfor\nstrengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a sharedomni-modal latent space; (ii)Temporal Embedding Groupingfor capturing\nrelative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)Constrained Rotary Time Embeddingfor encoding absolute temporal information in\nomni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that\ngenerates 24M single-modal andomni-modal conversations. We find that\nmodalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,\nOmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 onDailyOmni(cross-modal\nunderstanding), +1.7 onMMAR(audio), and +3.9 onVideo-MME(vision), while\nusing just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to\nQwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrateomni-modal advantagesin downstream\napplications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.
