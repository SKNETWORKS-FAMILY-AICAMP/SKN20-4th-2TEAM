  "context": "Emergent misalignment occurs in in-context learning across multiple models and datasets, with misaligned responses increasing with the number of examples provided. Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned\nLLMs, a phenomenon termedemergent misalignment(EM). While concerning, these\nfindings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving outin-context learning(ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find\nthat it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly\nmisaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context\nexamples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by\neliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).\nManual analysis of the resultingchain-of-thoughtshows that 67.5% of\nmisaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless\nor dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM. We show that Emergent Misalignment extends to in-context learning paradigm. Would be glad to discuss practical implications of this! This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
