  "context": "Seed3D 1.0 generates scalable, physics-accurate 3D assets from images for use in simulation environments, enhancing both content diversity and real-time physics feedback. Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that\nbalance content diversity with physics accuracy.World simulatorsprovide such\nenvironments but face distinct limitations:video-based methodsgenerate\ndiverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning,\nwhilephysics-based enginesprovide accurate dynamics but face scalability\nlimitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a\nfoundation model that generatessimulation-ready 3D assetsfrom single images,\naddressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike\nexisting 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate\ngeometry,well-aligned textures, and realisticphysically-based materials.\nThese assets can be directly integrated intophysics engineswith minimal\nconfiguration, enabling deployment inrobotic manipulationand simulation\ntraining. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene\ngeneration through assembling objects intocoherent environments. By enabling\nscalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation\nfor advancing physics-basedworld simulators.
