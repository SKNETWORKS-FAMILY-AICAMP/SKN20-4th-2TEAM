  "context": "Freephdlabor is an open-source multiagent framework that supports dynamic workflows, modular architecture, and context management to enable continual and interactive automated scientific research. The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for\nscience suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed\nworkflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context\nmanagement that hinders long-horizon research. We present\nfreephdlabor, an open-source multiagent framework featuringfully dynamic workflowsdetermined by real-time agent reasoning and a\n\\textit{modular architecture} enabling seamless customization --\nusers can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific\nrequirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure includingautomatic context compaction,workspace-based communicationto prevent information degradation,memory persistenceacross\nsessions, andnon-blocking human interventionmechanisms. These\nfeatures collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run\nattempts intocontinual research programsthat build systematically on\nprior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the\narchitectural principles and practical implementation for building customizableco-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of\nautomated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy\ninteractive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --\nfrom ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts. freephdlabor is an open-source multiagent framework that automates the complete scientific research lifecycle—from hypothesis generation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.
