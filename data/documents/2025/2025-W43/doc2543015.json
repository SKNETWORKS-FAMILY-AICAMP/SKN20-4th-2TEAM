  "context": "UniGenBench++ is a comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image generation that evaluates semantic consistency across diverse scenarios and languages using a hierarchical prompt structure and a robust evaluation pipeline. Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance\nof reliablebenchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect\nthe semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existingbenchmarks lack\nthe diversity ofprompt scenariosandmultilingual support, both essential for\nreal-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary\ndimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in\nfine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce UniGenBench++, a unifiedsemantic assessmentbenchmarkfor T2I\ngeneration. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to\nensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world\nscenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively\nprobes T2I models'semantic consistencyover 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation\ncriteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess\nmodel robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both\nEnglish and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging\nthe general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities\nof a closed-sourceMulti-modal Large Language Model(MLLM), i.e.,Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliablebenchmarkconstruction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate\ncommunity use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline\nassessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensivebenchmarking of both\nopen- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths\nand weaknesses across various aspects.
