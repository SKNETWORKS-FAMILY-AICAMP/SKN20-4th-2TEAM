Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban\nscenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied\napplications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality\nreal-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this\npaper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by\nsynergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic\ncoarse geometry and the open-domaindiffusion modelfor creating high-quality\nclose-up appearances. We proposeSkyfall-GS, the first city-block\nscale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring\nreal-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative\nrefinement strategy to progressively enhancegeometric completenessandphotorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatSkyfall-GSprovides improvedcross-view consistent geometryand more realistic textures\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches.
