  "context": "StageVAR accelerates visual autoregressive models by selectively pruning or approximating less critical later stages, achieving significant speedup with minimal quality loss. Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modelingdeparts from thenext-token predictionparadigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models throughnext-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increasedcomputational complexityand running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study andstage-aware accelerationframework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic andstructural consistencyand should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces aplug-and-play accelerationstrategy that exploitssemantic irrelevanceandlow-rank propertiesin late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4xspeedupwith only a 0.01 drop onGenEvaland a 0.26 decrease onDPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle forefficient visual autoregressive image generation. github:https://github.com/sen-mao/StageVAR arXiv lens breakdown of this paper 👉https://arxivlens.com/PaperView/Details/stagevar-stage-aware-acceleration-for-visual-autoregressive-models-2828-0755b45c ·Sign uporlog into comment",
