  "context": "We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard. We present C2LLM, a family of frontier code embedding models that ranks 1st (7B) and 6th (0.5B) on the MTEB-Code leaderboard. C2LLM introduces Pooling by Multi-head Attention (PMA) into embedding models, bypassing the historical dilemma between mean pooling and EOS representation in embedding models. arXiv lens breakdown of this paper 👉https://arxivlens.com/PaperView/Details/c2llm-technical-report-a-new-frontier-in-code-retrieval-via-adaptive-cross-attention-pooling-2901-289a35b0 ·Sign uporlog into comment",
