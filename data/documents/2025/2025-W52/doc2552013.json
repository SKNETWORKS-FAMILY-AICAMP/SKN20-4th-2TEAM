  "context": "A multi-agent framework, involving a master LLM, grounding agent, and vision agent, enhances long-video QA by improving temporal grounding and leveraging visual and textual data. Recent advances inmultimodal LLMsand systems that use tools forlong-video QApoint to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakeningtemporal groundingand missing fine-grained cues. We propose amulti-agent frameworkin which a master LLM coordinates agrounding agentto localize question-relevant segments and avision agentto extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained withreinforcement learningto encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposedLongTVQAandLongTVQA+which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also showreinforcement learningfurther strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.
