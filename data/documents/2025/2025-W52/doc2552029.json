  "context": "MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework, enhances self-evolving memory systems by jointly evolving agents' experiential knowledge and memory architecture, leading to improved performance and generalization. Self-evolving memory systemsare unprecedentedly reshaping the evolutionary paradigm oflarge language model(LLM)-based agents. Prior work has predominantly relied on manually engineeredmemory architecturestostoretrajectories, distill experience, and synthesize reusable tools, enabling agents to evolve on the fly within environment interactions. However, this paradigm is fundamentally constrained by the staticity of the memory system itself: while memory facilitates agent-level evolving, the underlying memory architecture cannot be meta-adapted to diverse task contexts. To address this gap, we proposeMemEvolve, ameta-evolutionary frameworkthat jointly evolves agents' experiential knowledge and their memory architecture, allowing agent systems not only to accumulate experience but also to progressively refine how they learn from it. To groundMemEvolvein prior research and foster openness in future self-evolving systems, we introduceEvolveLab, a unified self-evolving memory codebase that distills twelve representative memory systems into amodular design space(encode,store,retrieve,manage), providing both a standardized implementation substrate and a fair experimental arena. Extensive evaluations on four challenging agentic benchmarks demonstrate thatMemEvolveachieves (I) substantial performance gains, improving frameworks such asSmolAgentandFlash-Searcherby up to 17.06%; and (II) strong cross-task and cross-LLM generalization, designingmemory architecturesthat transfer effectively across diverse benchmarks and backbone models.
