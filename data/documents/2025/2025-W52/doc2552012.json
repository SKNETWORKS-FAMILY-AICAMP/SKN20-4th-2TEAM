  "context": "A framework called Laws of Reasoning (LoRe) is introduced to theoretically define desired reasoning behaviors in Large Reasoning Models, with a focus on compute and accuracy laws, and a benchmark (LoRe-Bench) to measure these properties. Despite the superior performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their reasoning behaviors are often counterintuitive, leading to suboptimal reasoning capabilities. To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents theLaws of Reasoning(LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first proposecompute lawwith the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly withquestion complexity. Beyond compute, we extendLoRewith a supplementaryaccuracy law. Since thequestion complexityis difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws,monotonicityandcompositionality. We therefore introduceLoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonablemonotonicitybut lackcompositionality. In response, we develop an effectivefinetuning approachthat enforcescompute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance withcompute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.
