  "context": "INTELLECT-3, a large Mixture-of-Experts model trained with reinforcement learning, achieves top performance across various benchmarks and is supported by an open-source RL infrastructure framework. We present INTELLECT-3, a 106B-parameterMixture-of-Expertsmodel (12B active) trained with large-scalereinforcement learningon our end-to-endRL infrastructurestack. INTELLECT-3 achieves state of the art performance for its size across math, code, science and reasoning benchmarks, outperforming many larger frontier models. We open-source the model together with the full infrastructure stack used to create it, including RL frameworks, complete recipe, and a wide collection of environments, built with the verifiers library, for training and evaluation from our Environments Hub community platform. Built for this effort, we introduceprime-rl, an open framework for large-scaleasynchronous reinforcement learning, which scales seamlessly from a single node to thousands of GPUs, and is tailored for agentic RL with first-class support for multi-turn interactions and tool use. Using this stack, we run bothSFTand RL training on top of theGLM-4.5-Air-Basemodel, scaling RL training up to 512H200swith high training efficiency.
