  "context": "Step-DeepResearch, an end-to-end agent enhanced with a data synthesis strategy and progressive training, achieves expert-level capabilities in deep research scenarios, outperforming established models. As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents,Deep Researchhas emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks likeBrowseCompoften fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduceStep-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose aData Synthesis StrategyBased onAtomic Capabilitiesto reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path fromagentic mid-trainingtoSFTandRL. Enhanced by aChecklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establishADR-Benchfor realisticdeep researchscenarios. Experimental results show thatStep-DeepResearch(32B) scores 61.4% onScale AI Research Rubrics. OnADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models likeOpenAIandGemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.
