Benchmarks likeSWE-benchhave standardized the evaluation ofLarge Language Models(LLMs) on repository-level software engineering tasks. However, these efforts remain limited by manual curation, static datasets, and a focus on Python-based bug fixes. We introduceSWE-Bench++, an automated framework that generates repository-level coding tasks from open-source GitHub projects. Unlike synthetic approaches, our pipeline harvests live pull requests to cover both bug fixes and feature requests across 11 languages.SWE-Bench++turnsGitHub pull requests(PRs) into reproducible, execution-based tasks via four stages:programmatic sourcing,environment synthesis,test oracle extraction, andquality assurance. A finalhint-guided trajectory synthesisstep converts instances that strong models fail on into training trajectories. Our initial benchmark consists of 11,133 instances from 3,971 repositories across 11 languages. On a subset of 1,782 instances of this benchmark, today's strongest models perform as follows: claude-sonnet-4.5 achieves 36.20%pass@10, gpt-5-2025-08-07 34.57%, gemini/gemini-2.5-pro 24.92%, and gpt-4o 16.89%. We further demonstrate the utility of our dataset by showing that fine-tuning onSWE-Bench++instances yields measurable improvements on theSWE-bench Multilingualbenchmark.SWE-Bench++provides a scalable, multilingual benchmark for evaluating and improving repository-level code generation.
