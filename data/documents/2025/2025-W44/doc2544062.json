  "context": "Optimizing the max@k metric through unbiased gradient estimates in RLVR improves the diversity and performance of Large Language Models in Best-of-N sampling scenarios. The application ofReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)to\nmathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in\nthe reasoning and problem-solving abilities ofLarge Language Models. Despite\nits success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning\nfine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in\ndecreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance\nduringBest-of-N samplingfor large N values. In this work, we focus on\noptimizing themax@k metric, a continuous generalization ofpass@k. We derive\nan unbiasedon-policy gradient estimatefor direct optimization of this metric.\nFurthermore, we extend our derivations to theoff-policy updates, a common\nelement in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.\nEmpirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizesmax@k metricin\noff-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy. We explore how the best-of-n sampling works on code tasks. ·Sign uporlog into comment",
