Existingvision-language-action (VLA) modelsact in 3D real-world but are\ntypically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits\ngeneralization and adaptability. Recent3D integrationtechniques for VLAs\neither require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or\ninject weak cues that lack geometry and degradevision-language alignment. In\nthis work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that\ninjects rich 3Dspatial tokensinto the action head. FALCON leverages spatial\nfoundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and\nincludes anEmbodied Spatial Modelthat can optionally fuse depth, or pose for\nhigher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To\npreserve language reasoning,spatial tokensare consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced\nAction Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone.\nThese designs enable FALCON to address limitations inspatial representation,modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across\nthree simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive\nbaselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and\nvariations in object scale and height.
