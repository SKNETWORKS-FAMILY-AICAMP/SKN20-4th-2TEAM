  "context": "Toolathlon is a benchmark for language agents that evaluates their performance across diverse, realistic, and complex multi-step workflows involving multiple software applications and tools. Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across\ndiverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with\ncalendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect\nanomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce theTool Decathlon(dubbed asToolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation.Toolathlonspans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such asGoogle CalendarandNotionto\nprofessional ones likeWooCommerce,Kubernetes, andBigQuery. Most of the tools\nare based on a high-quality set ofModel Context Protocol(MCP) servers that we\nmay have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily\nensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we\nprovide realistic initial environment states from real software, such asCanvascourses with dozens of students or realfinancial spreadsheets. This benchmark\nincludes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting\nwith multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is\nstrictly verifiable through dedicatedevaluation scripts. Comprehensive\nevaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the\nbest-performing model,Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate\nwith 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights modelDeepSeek-V3.2-Expreaches 20.1%. We expectToolathlonto drive the development\nof more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.
