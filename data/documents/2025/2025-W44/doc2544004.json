  "context": "Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture, outperforms full attention in various scenarios with improved efficiency and performance, using Kimi Delta Attention and Multi-Head Latent Attention. We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybridlinear attentionarchitecture that, for\nthe first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across\nvarious scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement\nlearning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core liesKimi Delta Attention(KDA), an\nexpressivelinear attentionmodule that extendsGated DeltaNetwith a\nfiner-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limitedfinite-state RNN memory. Our bespokechunkwise algorithmachieves high hardware\nefficiency through a specialized variant of theDiagonal-Plus-Low-Rank(DPLR)\ntransition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the\ngeneral DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical\ndelta rule.\n  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total\nparameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention\n(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear\noutperforms fullMLAwith a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while\nreducingKV cacheusage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding\nthroughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be\na drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior\nperformance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output\nlengths.\n  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel andvLLMimplementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model\ncheckpoints.

Hi, whether the MLA attention layer in the hybrid ratio 0:1 configuration described in Table 1 includes positional embeddings? If not, the 0:1 configuration seems to be unfair  for MLA. @BillionZhengWe don't use any NoPE for any non-hybrid models arXiv explained breakdown of this paper 👉https://arxivexplained.com/papers/kimi-linear-an-expressive-efficient-attention-architecture ·Sign uporlog into comment",
