  "context": "The proposed method reformulates reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models as posterior inference using amortized variational inference and a sparse reward function, improving effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability. Chain-of-thought(CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the\ninterpretability and reliability ofLarge Vision-Language Models(LVLMs).\nHowever, existing training algorithms such asSFT,PPO, andGRPOmay not\ngeneralize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased\nreward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs asposterior inferenceand propose a scalable training algorithm based onamortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, we introduce a novelsparse reward functionfortoken-level learning signalsthat encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent\nCoT, overcomingdeterministic samplinglimitations and avoidingreward hacking.\nAdditionally, we implement aBayesian inference-scaling strategythat replaces\ncostly Best-of-N and Beam Search with amarginal likelihoodto efficiently rank\noptimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on sevenreasoning benchmarks, in\nterms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.
