  "context": "The Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm enhances GUI grounding by treating instructions as dynamic pathways, improving performance through multi-perspective reasoning and reinforcement learning. GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI\nelements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats\ninstructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of\ninstruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful\ninvestigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in\ntheir instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction\ndiversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In\nthis paper, we introduce theInstruction-as-Reasoningparadigm, treating\ninstructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives\nand enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.\nTo achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instillmulti-perspective reasoning, followed byreinforcement learning(RL) to\noptimizepathway selectionand composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and\nUI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding\nbenchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and\nsynthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B\nattains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on\nScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model\ndemonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on\nAndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals\nadditional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather\nthan hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigatespolicy collapsein the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly\nreleased in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.
