  "context": "RECALL is a representation-aware framework for continual learning in large language models that merges models without historical data, preserving domain-general features and adapting to task-specific knowledge. We unveil that internal representations inlarge language models(LLMs) serve\nas reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and proposeRECALL, a novelrepresentation-awaremodel merging framework forcontinual learningwithout\naccess to historical data.RECALLcomputesinter-model similarityfromlayer-wise hidden representationsover clustered typical samples, and performsadaptive,hierarchical parameter fusionto align knowledge across models. This\ndesign enables the preservation ofdomain-general featuresin shallow layers\nwhile allowingtask-specific adaptationin deeper layers. Unlike prior methods\nthat require task labels or incur performance trade-offs,RECALLachieves\nseamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic\nforgetting. Extensive experiments across fiveNLP tasksand multiple continual\nlearning scenarios show thatRECALLoutperforms baselines in both knowledge\nretention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for\nevolvingLLMs. ·Sign uporlog into comment",
