  "context": "MASPRM, a process reward model for multi-agent systems, enhances inference performance by guiding beam search and MCTS, improving exact match scores on GSM8K and MATH datasets. Practical deployment ofMulti-Agent Systems (MAS)demands strong test-time\nperformance, motivating methods that guide inference-time search and\nselectively spend compute to improve quality. We present the Multi-Agent System\nProcess Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns per-action, per-agent values to\npartial inter-agent transcripts and acts as aninference-time controller.\nMASPRM is trained frommulti-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)rollouts\nwithout requiring step-level human annotations, by propagating returns to local\ntargets. At inference, MASPRM guides step-levelbeam searchandMCTS, focusing\ncomputation on promising branches and pruning early. On GSM8K and MATH,\nMASPRM-guided decoding with anoutcome reward model (ORM)applied to the final\nanswer, improvesexact match (EM)over a single straight-through MAS pass by\n+30.7 and +22.9 points, respectively. A MASPRM trained on GSM8K transfers\nzero-shot to MATH without retraining, adding 8.4 EM points at the same\nbudget. MASPRM is a plug-in value model that estimates per-agent progress and\ncomplements verifier-style decoders, enabling more reliable, compute-aware\nmulti-agent reasoning.
