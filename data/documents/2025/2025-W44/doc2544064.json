  "context": "Critique-RL is an online reinforcement learning approach for developing critiquing language models without strong supervision, using a two-stage optimization strategy to improve both the critic's discriminability and helpfulness. Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model\noutputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for\nannotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an onlineRLapproach for developing critiquing language models without stronger\nsupervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: theactorgenerates a response, thecriticprovides feedback, and theactorrefines the\nresponse accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward\nsignals from theactor's outputs forRLoptimization often leads to\nunsatisfactorycritics: while theirhelpfulness(i.e., providing constructive\nfeedback) improves, thediscriminability(i.e., determining whether a response\nis high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.\nTo overcome this, Critique-RLadopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In\nstage I, it reinforces thediscriminabilityof thecriticwith direct\nrule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based onactorrefinement to improve thecritic'shelpfulness, while maintaining itsdiscriminabilityvia appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across\nvarious tasks and models show that Critique-RLdelivers substantial performance\nimprovements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a\n5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks forQwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential. Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward signals from the actor’s outputs for RL optimization often leads to unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains. To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance improvements. For example, it achieves a $9.02%$ gain on in-domain tasks and a $5.70%$ gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential. Cool paper! Good point on first reinforcing the discriminability of the critic with the rule-based verifier. Would also like to draw the attention to our previous work on enhancing the critique capabilities of LLMs:DeepCritic: Deliberate Critique with Large Language Models.
