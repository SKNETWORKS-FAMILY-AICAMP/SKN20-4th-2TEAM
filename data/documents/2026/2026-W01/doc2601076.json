  "context": "This paper presents a new state-of-the-art algorithm for exact 3times3 matrix multiplication over general non-commutative rings, achieving a rank-23 scheme with only 58 scalar additions. This improves the previous best additive complexity of 60 additions without a change of basis. The result was discovered through an automated search combining ternary-restricted flip-graph exploration with greedy intersection reduction for common subexpression elimination. The resulting scheme uses only coefficients from {-1, 0, 1}, ensuring both efficiency and portability across arbitrary fields. The total scalar operation count is reduced from 83 to 81. A 58-addition, rank-23 scheme for exact 3×3 matrix multiplication sets a new SOTA. This improves the previous best of 60 additions without basis change. The scheme uses only ternary coefficients {-1,0,1} and was discovered via combinatorial flip-graph search + greedy CSE heuristics. This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
