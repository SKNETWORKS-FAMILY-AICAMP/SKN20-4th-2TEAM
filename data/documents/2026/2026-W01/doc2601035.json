  "context": "This paper presents JavisGPT, the first unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) for Joint Audio-Video (JAV) comprehension and generation. JavisGPT adopts a concise encoder-LLM-decoder architecture, featuring a SyncFusion module for spatio-temporal audio-video fusion and synchrony-aware learnable queries to bridge a pretrained JAV-DiT generator. This design enables temporally coherent video-audio understanding and generation from multimodal instructions. We design an effective three-stage training pipeline consisting of multimodal pretraining, audio-video fine-tuning, and large-scale instruction-tuning, to progressively build multimodal comprehension and generation from existing vision-language models. To support this, we further construct JavisInst-Omni, a high-quality instruction dataset with over 200K GPT-4o-curated audio-video-text dialogues that span diverse and multi-level comprehension and generation scenarios. Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings. 🔥🔥🔥 JavisGPT 🌟 We introduce JavisGPT, a multimodal LLM that can understand audiovisual inputs and simultaneously generate synchronized sounding videos in a unified model. 🤠 We contribute JavisInst-Omni, a dataset to facilitate diverse and complex instruction-tuning for comprehension and generation on sounding videos. 📝 Paper:https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23377🎉 Project:https://javisverse.github.io/JavisGPT-page/✨ Code:https://github.com/JavisVerse/JavisGPT This is an automated message from theLibrarian Bot.
