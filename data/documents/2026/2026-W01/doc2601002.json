  "context": "Youtu-LLM is a lightweight language model optimized for computational efficiency and agentic intelligence through a compact architecture, STEM-focused training curriculum, and scalable mid-training strategies for planning and reasoning tasks. We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a denseMulti-Latent Attention (MLA) architecturewith a novelSTEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a128k context window. This design enables robustlong-context reasoningandstate trackingwithin a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled \"Commonsense-STEM-Agent\" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented amulti-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) ScalableAgentic Mid-training: Specifically for theagentic mid-training, we employ diversedata construction schemesto synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalizeplanning and reflection behaviorseffectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsicagentic capabilities.
