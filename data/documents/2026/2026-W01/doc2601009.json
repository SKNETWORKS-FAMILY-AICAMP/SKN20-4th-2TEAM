  "context": "The Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE) introduces a principled infrastructure for agent development, combining post-training optimization, sandbox environments, and policy alignment to enhance long-horizon training stability and performance in real-world tasks. Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includesdata composition protocolsfor synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm,Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit oversemantic interaction chunksrather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduceTerminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks likeSWE-bench Verifiedand Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.
