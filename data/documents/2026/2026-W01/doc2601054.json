  "context": "SlideTailor, an agentic framework, generates user-aligned slides using implicit preferences from example pairs and visual templates, incorporating a chain-of-speech mechanism for oral narration alignment and a benchmark dataset for evaluation. Automatic presentation slide generation can greatly streamline content creation. However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspiredagentic framework,SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novelchain-of-speech mechanismto align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct abenchmark datasetthat captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designedinterpretable metricsfor robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.  We argue that presentation design is inherently subjective. Users have different preferences in terms of narrative structure, emphasis, conciseness, aesthetic choices, etc. So in this work, we ask:Can we better model such diverse user preferences for personalized paper-to-slides generation?
